2
00:00:29,090 --> 00:00:33,010
-Ah, hell, it's you.

3
00:00:36,050 --> 00:00:39,150
-He is very unhappy with you.

4
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:50,100
And if he is dissatisfied with someone ... -I need more time.

5
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,090
Today

6
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:13,090
Do you understand me well? Today.

7
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:16,190
Yes.

8
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:55,220
-Frank ... -Come on, please.

9
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,060
-Hello! Sorry, but today there will not be an interview.

10
00:02:01,030 --> 00:02:03,180
-What happened? - Lion had an attack. A heart.

11
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,010
Now he's in order more or less. But it will take a rest.

12
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,180
-Well, well, I hope everything will work out.

13
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,130
-Frank!

14
00:02:14,150 --> 00:02:18,190
I've been waiting for you for the past hour. Rise quickly.

15
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,190
Well, why are you stuck there? Time is short.

16
00:02:51,220 --> 00:02:56,100
Natasha, I feel great.

17
00:02:58,060 --> 00:03:01,000
Jackson, do you sleep at least sometimes?

18
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:05,090
-Bad. -Why so?

19
00:03:06,230 --> 00:03:09,120
- Nightmare. How are you?

20
00:03:11,020 --> 00:03:15,190
-Much better than doctors think. How much did your doctor give me?

21
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:20,000
Year? Half a year? Less?

22
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,100
Never listen to what the doctors say. They only ...

23
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,220
HEAVY SPEAKS: ... confusing. -Can you rest now today?

24
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:36,110
Shall we go to the lake? "Natashenka, do not worry.

25
00:03:36,130 --> 00:03:40,000
As we already finish. Yes, Frank?

26
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:42,210
-Yes. -So that's great.

27
00:03:42,230 --> 00:03:45,140
We will not waste time.

28
00:04:03,080 --> 00:04:05,170
Well, begin.

29
00:04:11,110 --> 00:04:13,230
-Your most vivid memory of childhood?

30
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:15,160
-Oh you!

31
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,170
Let me see...

32
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:29,030
I was four years old. Walked in the garden with a nanny - cook's daughter.

33
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:36,000
She saw a bite in the bushes and ... poked him with a stick.

34
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:41,190
And it turned out to be a viper. Nurse ran away - I could not.

35
00:04:41,210 --> 00:04:48,100
I literally pinned down. Paralyzing horror.

36
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:53,200
I could not do anything. Legs grew to the ground.

37
00:04:53,220 --> 00:05:00,050
Fortunately, the snake did not touch me. Has crept away.

38
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,230
-And the moment when it became clear - everything, victory? Do you remember him?

39
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:13,020
"Of course.

40
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:22,080
Clearly I remember. I received a telegram from Tukhachevsky.

41
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:27,040
At that time he suppressed the rebellion of Antonov, our last

42
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:32,010
a serious enemy. I remember word for word:

43
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:36,100
"The insurgency is eliminated

44
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,160
Soviet power is established elsewhere throughout the world. "

45
00:06:03,210 --> 00:06:09,220
This is a historical moment. Remember it.

46
00:06:10,170 --> 00:06:16,060
I want to appeal to the people. Wire to the nearest station.

47
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:19,220
Let them gather all: the population, the soldier - of all who can.

48
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,040
THE REVOLUTIONARY SONG

49
00:07:10,010 --> 00:07:12,240
- Picked up all who could.

50
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:08,050
SIGNALIT

51
00:08:12,220 --> 00:08:15,120
-Put on livelihood. -I have nothing.

52
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,110
-I did not eat for three days. I'm dying. Give me something.

53
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:24,030
-I'm sorry, but I really have nothing.

54
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:45,060
- Forgive me, for God's sake! -Nothing.

55
00:08:45,080 --> 00:08:47,050
Thank you.

56
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:56,070
-Standing physics in your spare time? -I do not study. I'm interested.

57
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,060
I want to get to the point, to find out how everything is arranged.

58
00:09:00,080 --> 00:09:05,060
-This strikingly distinguishes you from the current political elite.

59
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:09,240
But they, on the contrary, believe that everyone already knows for a long time,

60
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:15,090
and the reality is likely to fall under its theory. -Are you talking about someone specifically?

61
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:20,030
Do you know who Gorky is talking to now?

62
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:24,080
-Lev Davidovich, in Russia

63
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:27,100
30 million people are starving.

64
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:35,020
And most of all, the poor are suffering. These are the ones for which we are with you

65
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:39,120
and we are making this great social transformation.

66
00:09:40,210 --> 00:09:46,070
-The government is doing everything possible. -I mean citizens.

67
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:52,170
My friend Professor Prokopovich, the most prominent economist,

68
00:09:52,190 --> 00:09:57,160
proposes to organize collection of donations to the hungry.

69
00:09:57,180 --> 00:10:01,230
-I do not think you will be able to raise enough money.

70
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,120
From whom will you ask? There is no money in the country.

71
00:10:06,030 --> 00:10:10,040
-He seems to be seriously believing himself to be God, hoping to change

72
00:10:10,060 --> 00:10:15,060
social and economic laws. -And why do you think he has

73
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:20,070
nothing happens? So far, he has achieved everything he wanted.

74
00:10:20,090 --> 00:10:24,190
-If you really want to find out how everything is arranged, go to the higher

75
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,200
technological. - I'm already learning there.

76
00:10:26,220 --> 00:10:28,150
-Yes? Yes, on faculty.

77
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:35,020
-And I'm teaching there. On the economic side. Prokopovich Sergey Nikolaevich.

78
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,200
-Sedov. The Lion of Sedov. -Very nice.

79
00:10:39,180 --> 00:10:42,180
-My and Prokopovich know in the West.

80
00:10:43,190 --> 00:10:49,130
And, you see, the collected funds there can be significant.

81
00:10:49,150 --> 00:10:55,050
We will purchase products in Europe and America and deliver them in the most

82
00:10:55,070 --> 00:10:59,050
suffering areas. But without government support, this is impossible.

83
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:04,230
-I understood you. Anything else? - The other day I met with Blok.

84
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,060
He is very sick. Physicians who can help him, in the city

85
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:18,100
just did not remain. It needs to be taken to Finland, but in the GPU

86
00:11:18,120 --> 00:11:25,130
do not give documents, allegedly on the personal orders of Dzerzhinsky.

87
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:37,040
-In the near future I will raise this issue.

88
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,240
-Thank you. Thank you, Lev Davidovich. I had no doubt.

89
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,090
-I suggest Professor Prokopovich correct.

90
00:11:50,110 --> 00:11:53,210
In America there is overproduction. They burn excess grain in the furnaces

91
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:57,180
and with extra milk they feed the pigs. They will gladly sell us

92
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:01,120
surpluses at the lowest price. -You thought about political

93
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:06,010
consequences? This will put us in a disadvantageous position before the West.

94
00:12:06,030 --> 00:12:10,240
- Spit if it helps to solve the problem of hunger. Anyway

95
00:12:11,010 --> 00:12:15,060
we will have to establish contacts with them. "Comrade Lenin, do you think,

96
00:12:15,080 --> 00:12:19,120
can we accept handouts from the exploiting classes of the West?

97
00:12:19,140 --> 00:12:23,230
-That the rich share with the poor-that's right. But, if it will be

98
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,220
charity, it will be humiliating. Comrade Stalin is right.

99
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:31,090
We have to pay. Otherwise, in the eyes of the peasants we will look

100
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,060
inconsistent. -Restaurants are of little interest

101
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:38,020
our sequence with you. They are starving to death.

102
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:41,090
-That means we can and should take advantage of their mood.

103
00:12:41,110 --> 00:12:45,160
Right now, when people eat people on the Volga, we can with the most rabid

104
00:12:45,180 --> 00:12:50,000
energy to seize church values ​​and sell them to the West.

105
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:54,210
-We will encounter resistance. -I really hope so.

106
00:12:54,230 --> 00:12:58,110
And the more priests we will be able to shoot, the better.

107
00:12:58,130 --> 00:13:02,020
I'm talking about the resistance of the peasants. -You do not need to overestimate

108
00:13:02,040 --> 00:13:06,070
their importance. The village is now weak, but we are strong. It is necessary to use

109
00:13:06,090 --> 00:13:09,160
situation. Comrades, if there are no more questions for today ...

110
00:13:09,180 --> 00:13:15,120
-Vladimir Ilyich, I ... sent you a note about Blok and Gumilyov.

111
00:13:15,140 --> 00:13:19,040
Did you get acquainted? -The unit moved to positions

112
00:13:19,060 --> 00:13:23,030
counterrevolution. It is dangerous to release it abroad. We do not know what from him

113
00:13:23,050 --> 00:13:26,100
wait and what views he will preach.

114
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:30,140
-And what are you afraid of, Felix Edmundovich? Epigrams?

115
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,090
Unfounded repression against poets, we only demonstrate

116
00:13:34,110 --> 00:13:37,020
own weakness. -Foundable?

117
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:40,160
Do you question the work of the GPU? -I...

118
00:13:40,180 --> 00:13:45,200
- That's enough! Comrades ... I'm sorry, I feel unwell.

119
00:13:46,100 --> 00:13:49,050
Let's continue next time.

120
00:13:49,070 --> 00:13:51,020
Thank you.

121
00:13:55,200 --> 00:13:59,090
Lev Davidovich, stay for a moment, I beg of you.

122
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:11,110
I do not know how long I have left ... -Vladimir Ilyich ...

123
00:14:11,130 --> 00:14:15,080
"Take care of me of your vulgar pity, Trotsky."

124
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,190
We were never friends. But lately we've learned

125
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:23,200
tell each other the truth. It's ... it's beyond any friendship, in my opinion.

126
00:14:23,220 --> 00:14:28,090
Let's be frank. I must be sure that the work of my life

127
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:33,180
after my death will fall into safe hands. Stalin is rude and not far off.

128
00:14:33,200 --> 00:14:37,110
And he marks leaders. And you turned your manners away from yourself

129
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:41,190
all in the party. Tell me frankly, you are able to moderate

130
00:14:41,210 --> 00:14:45,060
your fervor and stop setting yourself against Dzerzhinsky?

131
00:14:45,080 --> 00:14:47,240
He is a real force. We need it.

132
00:14:51,060 --> 00:14:56,010
-If I agree, how do you see my future actions?

133
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:12,150
I. Stalin: Comrade Dzerzhinsky, come on.

134
00:15:20,030 --> 00:15:24,130
Any economic theory should be based on a specific

135
00:15:24,150 --> 00:15:26,210
historical research ...

136
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:29,150
-Professor Prokopovich?

137
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:36,090
Come with us. - I have a lecture. Allow me to finish?

138
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:40,060
Nothing.

139
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:42,130
Hey, what are you doing ?!

140
00:15:42,150 --> 00:15:45,090
Leave him! - Quiet, I said!

141
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:47,220
And I'll get to you.

142
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:51,000
TROTSKY HANDS

143
00:16:01,150 --> 00:16:06,130
-Father ... I never asked for anything. And took the name of his mother,

144
00:16:06,150 --> 00:16:10,020
so that no one knows that I am your son, to achieve everything myself.

145
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:13,130
-If your professor is innocent, he will be released.

146
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,020
-I beg, help. -We have already discussed this with you.

147
00:16:18,040 --> 00:16:21,200
- Can you imagine that Professor Prokopovich is an enemy?

148
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:25,160
-I believe in the competence of the GPU staff and I'm not going to tell you anything.

149
00:16:25,180 --> 00:16:29,030
to explain, the more justify.

150
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:32,180
-The left is right.

151
00:16:35,030 --> 00:16:37,180
-What? -We were arrested in the museum department

152
00:16:37,200 --> 00:16:41,050
archivist. He is 70 years old. Throughout Moscow, the intelligentsia is poisoned,

153
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,010
grab writers, philosophers, teachers. They are not terrorists.

154
00:16:45,030 --> 00:16:46,200
-That's it!

155
00:17:10,120 --> 00:17:15,180
LETTER: "Hello Lev Davidovich: In case you are too busy,

156
00:17:15,200 --> 00:17:20,090
to follow the news, I will inform you: Block died three weeks ago,

157
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:26,130
Gumilyov was shot the day before yesterday. I do not blame you for their death,

158
00:17:26,150 --> 00:17:32,060
guilt lies with us all. To defeat the enemy, we created Moloch,

159
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:38,040
they nurtured him, nurtured the blood of the victims. Now the enemies are defeated,

160
00:17:38,060 --> 00:17:44,060
but he wants more. Guilty, innocent, enemies, friends -

161
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,220
does not matter. He is hungry, he needs food. He started with poets, because

162
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:57,170
they are weaker than others, but, having grown teeth, he will take prey more seriously.

163
00:17:57,190 --> 00:18:02,210
You have cast down the persecutor, so do not become it yourself.

164
00:18:02,230 --> 00:18:07,230
Be merciful. Maksim Gorky".

165
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:28,030
-You were the second person in the country. Could not you stop it?

166
00:18:30,020 --> 00:18:36,180
-The civil war is over, but the world revolution was still

167
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:44,080
ahead. And the main battle - for the minds - we still had to win.

168
00:18:45,010 --> 00:18:48,200
War, revolution ... You always justify violence by emergency

169
00:18:48,220 --> 00:18:52,230
circumstances. But in reality you have doomed to death thousands of innocent people.

170
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:57,220
How do you justify this? -In the name of the common victory ...

171
00:18:59,050 --> 00:19:05,020
sometimes it is necessary to concede. Yes, I sacrificed them.

172
00:19:05,240 --> 00:19:09,020
But later he saved many others.

173
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:20,060
When? - At the plenum.

174
00:19:21,180 --> 00:19:26,020
We will oppose him together and withdraw from the Central Committee.

175
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:29,160
-But Stalin just will not give up.

176
00:19:29,180 --> 00:19:35,080
-Yes, of course, he will try to stir up a mutiny. But with what forces?

177
00:19:36,220 --> 00:19:41,000
The people do not know him. Everything he can count on, -

178
00:19:41,020 --> 00:19:46,170
this is Dzerzhinsky, not the Cheka. "In that case, I'll raise the army."

179
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,240
- And destroy everything we fought for?

180
00:19:51,150 --> 00:19:55,050
The second civil war will incinerate the country.

181
00:19:56,010 --> 00:19:58,120
What do you want to rule, a desert?

182
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:05,240
-Dzherzhinsky was carried away. The need for terror has disappeared,

183
00:20:06,010 --> 00:20:10,130
and prisons burst from prisoners. Well, I would still plant a counter,

184
00:20:10,150 --> 00:20:15,190
so no, he took up the professor. -First poets, now professors!

185
00:20:16,070 --> 00:20:24,060
Leo, you calm down. We decide the fate of the country and the revolution, and you are being treated

186
00:20:24,080 --> 00:20:27,110
about some kind of intelligentsia! -Are you okay?

187
00:20:27,130 --> 00:20:29,050
- Do not feel sorry for me!

188
00:20:29,230 --> 00:20:34,030
And no one should be pitied. You must be strong and ruthless -

189
00:20:34,050 --> 00:20:37,170
only then you can win. Nadia, I'm fine,

190
00:20:37,190 --> 00:20:40,140
I'm fine. -I can see in what order you are.

191
00:20:40,160 --> 00:20:44,170
You need to rest, but not work. And you are indulging him, Lev Davidovich.

192
00:20:44,190 --> 00:20:47,110
- I called him. -I'll take it.

193
00:20:47,130 --> 00:20:49,180
True, Lev Davidovich, go away.

194
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:54,150
-Trotsky, did you understand me? -Yes. Yes.

195
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:58,000
Have a rest.

196
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,220
The phone rings.

197
00:21:08,190 --> 00:21:13,190
-Secretariat. Fotieva. -Lidia Alexandrovna, Stalin.

198
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:17,200
-Ah, hello, Iosif Vissarionovich.

199
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:23,020
-Good afternoon. Give me Ilyich. -And he's not, he's on a walk.

200
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,170
-One? -To my mind,

201
00:21:26,190 --> 00:21:30,090
with Lev Davidovich. Something to tell him when he'll be back?

202
00:21:30,110 --> 00:21:34,030
-It's not worth it. Thank you, Lydia Alexandrovna.

203
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:52,000
-And this is an act, comrade Ilyin!

204
00:21:52,180 --> 00:21:57,160
Sit down. You have to run after your colleagues,

205
00:21:57,180 --> 00:22:00,170
and you, therefore, have appeared. They showed consciousness.

206
00:22:00,190 --> 00:22:04,130
-I do not find it possible to hide, if they are looking for me. Let me find out,

207
00:22:04,150 --> 00:22:06,240
What are they accusing me of? -Is this important?

208
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:11,070
-And still? -In refusal to cooperate

209
00:22:11,090 --> 00:22:14,240
with Soviet power, if you want. -I did not refuse to cooperate.

210
00:22:15,010 --> 00:22:16,180
with your power.

211
00:22:19,100 --> 00:22:23,210
- "Your"? Is not she yours, Ivan Alexandrovich?

212
00:22:24,180 --> 00:22:28,110
Have not we brought you freedom from age-old oppression?

213
00:22:28,130 --> 00:22:32,150
-You really brought freedom to people ... of a different kind -

214
00:22:32,170 --> 00:22:34,150
freedom from conscience.

215
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:42,160
- Do you know how this house is called among the people?

216
00:22:44,030 --> 00:22:45,230
-The ship of death.

217
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:51,140
-Well, I'm asking aboard.

218
00:22:53,210 --> 00:22:57,200
-In response to the restriction of freedom of speech, suppression of the system

219
00:22:57,220 --> 00:23:05,010
independent higher education in the country, in response to arrests,

220
00:23:05,030 --> 00:23:10,150
The prosecution of the teaching staff of universities we declare

221
00:23:10,170 --> 00:23:14,110
general indefinite strike.

222
00:23:16,040 --> 00:23:22,130
And we offer students, teachers, everyone,

223
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:28,040
who cares about the fate of education in Russia, join us.

224
00:23:33,230 --> 00:23:37,190
-Done new tyrants! Down with the new kings!

225
00:23:39,210 --> 00:23:42,220
ALARM MUSIC

226
00:23:54,010 --> 00:23:57,150
Down with the new tyrants! CROWD: Down with the new tyrants!

227
00:23:57,170 --> 00:24:00,200
-Done new kings! CROWD: Down with the new kings!

228
00:24:00,220 --> 00:24:03,240
-Done new tyrants! CROWD: Down with the new tyrants!

229
00:24:04,010 --> 00:24:05,110
-Done new kings!

230
00:24:20,120 --> 00:24:23,150
- Thank you, Commissioner. -It's not worth it, Comrade Trotsky.

231
00:24:23,170 --> 00:24:27,190
I understand everything: the mistakes of youth ... Who does not happen?

232
00:24:32,050 --> 00:24:35,040
I did not make out. -Thanks again.

233
00:24:36,080 --> 00:24:38,010
{717}{}{Goodbye!}

234
00:24:39,030 --> 00:24:40,150
Come along.

235
00:24:45,210 --> 00:24:49,080
-What the hell are you doing ?! -That you should have done, -

236
00:24:49,100 --> 00:24:54,050
uphold freedom and justice! -What do you understand about justice,

237
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,010
Snotty ?! -A lion!

238
00:24:56,030 --> 00:24:58,130
- Do not interfere. Let me talk with my son.

239
00:24:59,100 --> 00:25:02,060
Do you even understand that my enemies will take advantage of this?

240
00:25:02,080 --> 00:25:06,130
You hit me in the back, you're ruining what I'm building.

241
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:10,180
-What are you building? Bright future? With whom you will go there,

242
00:25:10,200 --> 00:25:14,140
if you destroy everyone who thinks differently? With wordless slaves

243
00:25:14,160 --> 00:25:18,080
without brains? I do not want such a future. You are not a revolutionary

244
00:25:18,100 --> 00:25:21,220
and not a prophet, you are a hypocrite, an executioner and a usurper! You're the worst of all!

245
00:25:32,040 --> 00:25:35,110
I loved you, you were everything to me.

246
00:25:36,080 --> 00:25:40,080
But now I see how small you are, how scared you are for your little world.

247
00:25:41,020 --> 00:25:44,030
I hate you. And I do not want to see.

248
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:55,000
Leo ... - Leave him alone!

249
00:25:57,180 --> 00:25:59,140
Let him go.

250
00:26:00,210 --> 00:26:03,230
Which of them is the most authoritative? -Ilyin, I suppose.

251
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:06,240
-Why arrested? -Don't worry, we're just here

252
00:26:07,010 --> 00:26:08,180
do not call. -I asked the question.

253
00:26:08,200 --> 00:26:11,060
-Effect of counter-revolution. -In any form?

254
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:13,190
-Explain. -Take, I want to talk.

255
00:26:13,210 --> 00:26:16,010
- It's time to waste.

256
00:26:18,130 --> 00:26:20,070
yes, sir!

257
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:29,220
Do you know who I am? -Yes.

258
00:26:29,240 --> 00:26:36,070
-Oh well. I will not go around in circles. We intend to put an end to the internal

259
00:26:36,090 --> 00:26:40,100
counter-revolution, which you and the like support you.

260
00:26:40,120 --> 00:26:44,170
But I would like to give you a chance to escape punishment. And in return for me

261
00:26:44,190 --> 00:26:48,170
You will need proof of your loyalty.

262
00:26:48,190 --> 00:26:52,160
A collective letter signed by you, your colleagues, with a public

263
00:26:52,180 --> 00:26:57,120
recognition of Soviet power. I will not hide - we need you, your mind,

264
00:26:57,140 --> 00:27:03,110
Your knowledge to rebuild the country anew and make it the greatest

265
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:09,190
in the world. In return, you get decent living conditions for you and your families.

266
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,190
It's impossible for me. -Why?

267
00:27:15,040 --> 00:27:18,010
-You are a liar, a thief and a murderer.

268
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:29,050
Under the guise of freedom you brought to people the greatest slavery. You killed the Russians

269
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,200
more than in any of the wars known in the history of Russia.

270
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:35,040
And after that you ask me why?

271
00:27:35,060 --> 00:27:41,020
-You know what? Do not wring your hands. You lose, learn to look

272
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:43,080
to the future. -Future?

273
00:27:43,100 --> 00:27:47,130
Your future has already come. Here, in these stone chambers.

274
00:27:47,150 --> 00:27:51,040
Here it is, look. All your achievements will be based on pain,

275
00:27:51,060 --> 00:27:56,020
torture, fear. You are tearing people's admission of loyalty to you and your

276
00:27:56,040 --> 00:27:59,190
ideas of torture. -Your escapades

277
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:04,230
I absolutely do not touch, although, it seems, you are sincere in your gusts.

278
00:28:05,200 --> 00:28:10,100
If we are such a creature of hell, why did the people support us?

279
00:28:10,120 --> 00:28:15,090
The power was supported by the mob, not the people. Your revolution is a rebellion of a bandit,

280
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:20,160
the criminal. The rest were intimidated or tempted by the idea of ​​an earthly material

281
00:28:20,180 --> 00:28:27,160
paradise. This is the cunning of Satan. -We just restored

282
00:28:27,180 --> 00:28:32,230
justice. For you, the earthly paradise is the Russian Empire of pattern

283
00:28:33,000 --> 00:28:39,060
commercials of 1913. Well, tell this to the starving peasants,

284
00:28:39,080 --> 00:28:44,120
tell the workers you held in check from drunkenness, ignorance.

285
00:28:44,140 --> 00:28:50,110
Hebrews tell me who did not have the right to settle in your neighborhood.

286
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:55,190
-The world you destroyed, Trotsky, was imperfect.

287
00:28:55,210 --> 00:28:57,130
There were scoundrels in him.

288
00:28:58,070 --> 00:29:05,150
You made all the bastards. You or the executioner, or applauding his slave.

289
00:29:06,050 --> 00:29:10,020
Your revolution is vulgar. Militant vulgarity.

290
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:14,160
You keep on fear. It's not for long. If the people do not overthrow

291
00:29:14,180 --> 00:29:17,220
you, you will strangle each other yourself.

292
00:29:20,040 --> 00:29:24,020
-Okay. Will you sign the letter? -No.

293
00:29:24,040 --> 00:29:28,210
-Good. Well, if you are ready to go to death - your will.

294
00:29:30,150 --> 00:29:34,140
Yes, you doom your comrades too.

295
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:38,190
-No. They doom you to death.

296
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:48,120
-The strike of professors is the same Kronstadt rebellion,

297
00:29:48,140 --> 00:29:53,170
Only with textbooks instead of weapons and not on the battlefield, but in the classrooms.

298
00:29:53,190 --> 00:30:00,220
Therefore, it is necessary to do the same: suppress mutiny and not be considered

299
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,160
with no sacrifices. -We have detained the most

300
00:30:04,180 --> 00:30:09,050
dangerous participants in the conspiracy of professors. 63 people.

301
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,070
Their shooting will sober up the rest of the professors and active students.

302
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:18,170
Those who continue will repeat their fate.

303
00:30:18,190 --> 00:30:20,220
-How long?

304
00:30:23,200 --> 00:30:26,220
-Sorry? -Doubts.

305
00:30:26,240 --> 00:30:31,150
This property of the developed mind. Only a fool and a scoundrel do not doubt.

306
00:30:32,060 --> 00:30:36,230
If we repeatedly destroy dissenters with us,

307
00:30:37,000 --> 00:30:41,070
with whom do we end up as a result? -I think Lev Davidovich

308
00:30:41,090 --> 00:30:45,150
no worse than you and I know that these professors are ideological enemies.

309
00:30:45,170 --> 00:30:49,050
We can not endure endlessly their counter-revolutionary antics.

310
00:30:49,070 --> 00:30:54,010
-Yes, but there's nothing to shoot them for. -They participated in the counter-revolutionary

311
00:30:54,030 --> 00:30:56,100
conspiracy. -The invented.

312
00:30:56,120 --> 00:31:01,110
Fictional by you. Their whole conspiracy is the refusal to work in conditions,

313
00:31:01,130 --> 00:31:08,040
which we impose on them. The shooting of the world's most popular intellectuals

314
00:31:08,060 --> 00:31:12,150
we will alienate the intellectuals of the West, many of whom

315
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:17,010
support. Therefore, we will remain without credits,

316
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:22,130
technologies, specialists, without which our industrialization will suffocate.

317
00:31:22,150 --> 00:31:27,080
-Will we dance to the tune of the West? -Yes, we will, if it helps us

318
00:31:27,100 --> 00:31:33,010
overtake them. While we are weaker, we must hide our pride and learn everything,

319
00:31:33,030 --> 00:31:35,040
what can teach us.

320
00:31:39,090 --> 00:31:42,070
-Ilyin, on the way out.

321
00:31:46,230 --> 00:31:48,110
Ladies and gentlemen!

322
00:31:50,140 --> 00:31:54,020
Apparently, my turn came. Farewell.

323
00:31:55,100 --> 00:31:56,210
Farewell!

324
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,000
- Let's go faster!

325
00:32:06,190 --> 00:32:10,160
-In war, violence was justified.

326
00:32:11,190 --> 00:32:15,210
Fear of repression is the weapon of the weak on the road to victory.

327
00:32:16,160 --> 00:32:19,100
But to pardon is the right of the strong.

328
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:26,150
This is the privilege of the winners. Miluya, we prove to the whole world:

329
00:32:26,170 --> 00:32:32,150
we have won, we are confident in ourselves and we can not be afraid of the dissenters.

330
00:32:32,170 --> 00:32:34,230
-Everything is clear ... -Tourist Lenin ...

331
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:36,140
minute

332
00:32:40,190 --> 00:32:45,150
What exactly do you propose? Endure endlessly counter-revolutionary attacks?

333
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:51,050
-No. Send them out of the country as an undesirable element.

334
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:56,020
- Yes, this is a gift for them. Abroad, they will continue

335
00:32:56,040 --> 00:33:00,000
counter-revolutionary activity. -Yes, let him. What, there it is not?

336
00:33:00,020 --> 00:33:04,080
There are plenty of enemies. Professors will only merge into a common

337
00:33:04,100 --> 00:33:09,080
howling. But we can get much more from this action.

338
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:12,000
-Do you lose? - Let's finish him.

339
00:33:12,020 --> 00:33:18,100
And what do you think we get? -Of people. The very ones who are now

340
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:22,180
they do not believe us. And we will show them that we are not afraid of a different opinion.

341
00:33:23,030 --> 00:33:27,180
You can bark, but not here. Get out, we are without you yourself

342
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:30,120
somehow. - Either it's stupid,

343
00:33:30,140 --> 00:33:33,000
or counter-revolution. -Felix Edmundovich,

344
00:33:33,020 --> 00:33:37,070
I think, and so the position is clear. Let's move on to the vote.

345
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:41,070
Only members of the Politburo vote, therefore, Felix Edmundovich, I ask you

346
00:33:41,090 --> 00:33:45,240
abstain. So, who is for supporting the proposal

347
00:33:46,010 --> 00:33:47,210
Comrade Stalin?

348
00:33:57,140 --> 00:34:00,080
-Confirm. - I already said, I did not mean anything.

349
00:34:00,100 --> 00:34:02,080
sign ... -Change!

350
00:34:02,100 --> 00:34:05,210
-Who to support Comrade Trotsky's proposal?

351
00:34:19,160 --> 00:34:23,140
-Confirm that you will never return to Russia

352
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:26,200
under pain of death. If they let you out.

353
00:34:32,110 --> 00:34:37,120
-The accused, in case of consent to leave at his own expense, is released

354
00:34:37,140 --> 00:34:41,200
with the obligation to leave the RSFSR within five days.

355
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:46,150
Otherwise, it will be kept in a special department before expulsion.

356
00:34:46,170 --> 00:34:49,190
stage order. Is everyone clear?

357
00:34:51,110 --> 00:34:54,210
-Two votes to three passes the offer of a friend

358
00:34:54,230 --> 00:34:58,100
Trotsky. Felix Edmundovich, I ask you to prepare for the expulsion

359
00:34:58,120 --> 00:35:02,100
from the country of all the most dangerous, in your opinion, representatives

360
00:35:02,120 --> 00:35:05,000
intellectuals. Cleanse Russia.

361
00:35:20,070 --> 00:35:21,170
-Lev ...

362
00:35:32,160 --> 00:35:36,080
- Mom told me everything. Dad, I wanted to ...

363
00:35:52,080 --> 00:35:54,020
- Karsavin!

364
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:57,110
Luzsky!

365
00:35:58,210 --> 00:36:00,060
Trubetskoy!

366
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:03,120
Prokopovich!

367
00:36:04,190 --> 00:36:06,040
Franc!

368
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:08,080
Berdyaev!

369
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:11,020
Busheslavsky!

370
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:13,140
Kizevetter!

371
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:20,050
"It's not what you wanted, I know, but they still have life."

372
00:36:22,060 --> 00:36:27,100
Perhaps they will be able to return when I correct everything here.

373
00:36:35,190 --> 00:36:37,010
-Ilyin!

374
00:36:43,070 --> 00:36:45,130
Goblets!

375
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:47,230
Novikov!

376
00:36:48,220 --> 00:36:50,100
Yasensky!

377
00:36:51,190 --> 00:36:53,090
Ugryumov!

378
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:56,060
Flowers!

379
00:36:57,020 --> 00:36:58,100
Metitsky!

380
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:01,000
Romodanovsky!

381
00:37:02,020 --> 00:37:03,090
Siberian!

382
00:37:07,110 --> 00:37:11,090
- It's time to go to bed, it's time to go to bed. You should already have a rest.

383
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:14,010
-But the rest, he will soon bring me to the grave.

384
00:37:14,030 --> 00:37:17,030
-Well, what are you saying? - Nadenka, you understood perfectly,

385
00:37:17,050 --> 00:37:20,010
what I mean. Besides, I feel wonderful.

386
00:37:20,030 --> 00:37:22,100
We are already finishing with Lev Davidovich.

387
00:37:22,120 --> 00:37:26,070
"Five minutes, Nadezhda Konstantinovna, I swear."

388
00:37:26,090 --> 00:37:30,030
-I rely on your responsibility. -Yes. Come, thank you.

389
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:34,000
You forced us to open ahead of time.

390
00:37:34,020 --> 00:37:38,150
-Vladimir Ilyich, do not let fear prevail! Yes, Dzerzhinsky

391
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:42,210
lost, but we have a majority in the Politburo. At the plenum we will

392
00:37:42,230 --> 00:37:44,030
stronger.

393
00:37:45,220 --> 00:37:49,220
-Well, I'll have to count on my authority and your energy.

394
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:56,200
-Yes. It's time to throw off the masks. "I'll be the first to speak tomorrow,

395
00:37:56,220 --> 00:38:01,110
Stalin - the second, you - the third. I'll strike, I'll knock him out of the saddle.

396
00:38:01,130 --> 00:38:05,190
He can not navigate, improvisation is not his fad,

397
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:09,140
and mumbles speech. And then you will finish it.

398
00:38:09,160 --> 00:38:14,000
Subjecting him to spanking for the whole party, we will deprive him of his authority forever.

399
00:38:14,170 --> 00:38:17,190
Have you read it? -Short and murderous.

400
00:38:17,210 --> 00:38:19,030
"Yes?

401
00:38:22,010 --> 00:38:26,240
Never felt more alive. Lydia Alexandrovna!

402
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:31,010
Here, reprint it.

403
00:38:35,080 --> 00:38:37,060
Awful want a fight.

404
00:38:48,000 --> 00:38:49,190
-Switch with Stalin.

405
00:39:23,080 --> 00:39:27,110
- Lev Davidovich, you need an urgent telegram from the Kremlin.

406
00:39:27,130 --> 00:39:29,100
-What's there? Read it.

407
00:39:32,060 --> 00:39:38,110
- Vladimir Ilyich has a stroke. He is paralyzed, can not speak.

408
00:39:38,130 --> 00:39:43,240
The members of the Politburo in your absence decided not to cancel the plenum.

409
00:39:52,180 --> 00:39:56,160
-You can call it anything, but, in my opinion, you have simply lost.

410
00:39:56,180 --> 00:40:02,000
-When you look ahead all the time, there's no time to look back,

411
00:40:02,020 --> 00:40:06,040
and it allows the enemy to hit you in the back.

412
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:07,150
STOCK IN THE DOOR

413
00:40:07,170 --> 00:40:11,190
What, Natasha? -Courier from the Canadian embassy.

414
00:40:11,210 --> 00:40:14,080
He asks you, he says it's urgent.

415
00:40:54,210 --> 00:41:02,150
-After the attempt, the Mexicans made a request about all the foreigners,

416
00:41:02,170 --> 00:41:10,170
who were here. Jackson is not who he claims to be.

417
00:41:16,240 --> 00:41:20,090
-I'll call security. -Do not...

418
00:41:26,120 --> 00:41:31,210
We knew that this day would someday ...

419
00:41:34,050 --> 00:41:36,170
will come, Natasha.

420
00:41:41,110 --> 00:41:44,190
-I beg you, please ... -It's quiet, quiet.

421
00:41:55,190 --> 00:41:59,180
I made a decision.

422
00:42:01,180 --> 00:42:04,110
It will be better, believe me.

423
00:42:08,070 --> 00:42:09,240
Goodbye.

424
00:42:26,050 --> 00:42:28,000
I love you.

425
00:42:30,060 --> 00:42:35,010
I've always loved only you.

426
00:42:44,170 --> 00:42:46,040
- I know.

427
00:42:49,100 --> 00:42:51,090
I loved you, too.

428
00:42:54,050 --> 00:42:56,010
One of you.

429
00:43:23,120 --> 00:43:26,100
-Continue? -Yes!

430
00:43:28,160 --> 00:43:31,130
After a stroke, Lenin ...

431
00:43:33,050 --> 00:43:40,120
I retired, and very soon I was left alone, as if in a vacuum.

432
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:49,060
Stalin planted his people everywhere. This new breed of people

433
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:54,230
with empty eyes, ready to fulfill any will of the leader.

434
00:43:57,050 --> 00:44:01,010
And then it all ended.

435
00:44:05,100 --> 00:44:09,000
-I do not know that the opposition headed by Trotsky led

436
00:44:09,020 --> 00:44:11,050
hooligan bullying against Lenin ...

437
00:44:11,070 --> 00:44:12,240
-Save calm.

438
00:44:13,010 --> 00:44:17,100
-Trotsky can not be a communist, because he is a speculator

439
00:44:17,120 --> 00:44:19,070
in its Jewish nature!

440
00:44:19,090 --> 00:44:23,180
-Is it any wonder that Trotsky is scolding now in vain

441
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,160
one of Lenin's many students-Comrade Stalin?

442
00:44:28,180 --> 00:44:34,180
He does not believe in building socialism in Russia, because he does not believe

443
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,110
by virtue of the Russian people!

444
00:44:36,180 --> 00:44:38,180
-Run shot!

445
00:45:14,060 --> 00:45:17,070
-All is ready! Stop, where did you go ?!

446
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,050
{601}{}{Go on.}

447
00:45:21,020 --> 00:45:23,010
- Dad! Dad!

448
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:28,080
People! This is Leon Trotsky! This is arbitrary!

449
00:45:30,090 --> 00:45:32,240
Why are you silent, people ?!

450
00:45:38,240 --> 00:45:43,000
-In connection with the fact that Trotsky's activities took on the character of

451
00:45:43,020 --> 00:45:48,110
more and more open counter-revolution, the party is put in necessity

452
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:54,040
to send him outside the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics.

453
00:46:24,010 --> 00:46:28,130
-Last question. Catch you back ...

454
00:46:28,150 --> 00:46:31,170
-In Russia? -In the past.

455
00:46:31,190 --> 00:46:35,180
Come again to this path, what would you do differently,

456
00:46:35,200 --> 00:46:39,120
where would have turned? -Never where.

457
00:46:43,100 --> 00:46:49,070
-And how are your children, father, friends, comrades-in-arms, millions of victims?

458
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:53,070
-You did not understand anything.

459
00:46:53,190 --> 00:46:58,090
You cling to the little things. I changed the world.

460
00:46:59,080 --> 00:47:02,000
-No. No!

461
00:47:02,180 --> 00:47:08,020
You dared, but nothing happened. Everything that you did in your life,

462
00:47:08,040 --> 00:47:12,240
brought you here to life in fear and hatred, and will continue to

463
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,120
Only worse. You will rot day after day, convincing yourself,

464
00:47:16,140 --> 00:47:19,120
that you did everything right, but you will not believe it.

465
00:47:19,140 --> 00:47:22,000
You can not be saved even by suicide,

466
00:47:22,020 --> 00:47:25,040
because then you will sign your own defeat.

467
00:47:28,210 --> 00:47:32,090
Farewell, Trotsky. -Jackson!

468
00:47:33,110 --> 00:47:39,150
Remember, I told you that we are from the same test?

469
00:47:40,210 --> 00:47:42,090
Forget it.

470
00:47:44,030 --> 00:47:46,130
You are ... different.

471
00:47:52,040 --> 00:47:53,160
A coward.

472
00:47:55,190 --> 00:48:02,200
You do not have enough will to bring the matter to an end. I'm not talking about the will

473
00:48:02,220 --> 00:48:10,170
go beyond the imposed boundaries. Ask if I want to return ...

474
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:16,150
I will return necessarily, only not in the past, but in the future.

475
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:23,090
I threw seeds in the ground and they will ascend. Through pain, blood

476
00:48:23,110 --> 00:48:29,050
I showed people a new world, and they no longer want to live in the old.

477
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:35,030
Never. I set it on fire, it burns. Can you smell it?

478
00:48:35,050 --> 00:48:40,020
Smell! The smell of burning! The only thing I regret is that I was not

479
00:48:40,040 --> 00:48:45,080
rather cruel and consistent, showed softness where necessary

480
00:48:45,100 --> 00:48:48,240
have a firm hand. I stepped back where I had to go forward,

481
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:54,040
without regard for any sacrifices. Nothing, this world is on fire

482
00:48:54,060 --> 00:48:58,180
in the flame of a new war. And who knows what it will lead to?

483
00:48:58,200 --> 00:49:04,050
and will your Stalin hold out. I feel the power in me.

484
00:49:04,070 --> 00:49:07,060
I feel the power! I'm ready to return!

485
00:49:36,090 --> 00:49:43,100
This war is a cleansing fire, in which a new,

486
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:45,150
just peace.

487
00:49:48,180 --> 00:49:54,100
My ideas are immortal, which means that I myself am immortal.
