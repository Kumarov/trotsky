2
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:46,130
IN SPANISH: I must search you, señor Jackson. New rules.

3
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:54,130
"Yes, Senor Trotsky has finally agreed to security?"

4
00:00:54,150 --> 00:00:59,050
- No one asked for his consent. We do not want Senor Trotsky

5
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:03,030
killed in our city and put us to ridicule.

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,020
Why do you need this?

7
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:13,180
-A common knife for papers.

8
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:20,060
- I'll keep it for myself. Take it when you leave.

9
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,080
-Good afternoon, Comrade Trotsky!

10
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:40,140
Do not you have anything else to entertain? -I worked in this chair since then,

11
00:01:40,160 --> 00:01:44,240
as here moved. And as you have already understood, after yesterday's

12
00:01:45,010 --> 00:01:49,000
I'm not going to give up either my ideas or my own

13
00:01:49,020 --> 00:01:55,000
Habits, no matter how many killers you send here ... your idol.

14
00:01:58,090 --> 00:02:01,210
-Can you call a carpenter better? He will do it better.

15
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,180
-And he refuses to come. Afraid that the infection will spill over

16
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,090
to his house. Ah, hell!

17
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,220
- Give me your hammer. Yes, do not be afraid, I know how to deal with it.

18
00:02:14,240 --> 00:02:17,050
to be managed. -You are welcome.

19
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:23,070
-You are constantly calling Stalin a murderer. And you? Are you not the same

20
00:02:23,090 --> 00:02:26,030
a bloodthirsty tyrant? How many victims are there in your account?

21
00:02:26,050 --> 00:02:29,230
-The critical situation required critical measures.

22
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,210
The question is not the number of victims, but the fact that they are brought for what.

23
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,090
-The dead are always dead. -This is why you should think

24
00:02:38,110 --> 00:02:43,160
about the living! They own the future. The death of the past fertilizes the present

25
00:02:43,180 --> 00:02:47,170
and generates the future. All. -All losers justified tyrants

26
00:02:47,190 --> 00:02:52,000
sacrifices made by great goals and by the fact that contemporaries

27
00:02:52,020 --> 00:02:56,150
could not understand them. -If there was an opportunity to avoid

28
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:00,100
I did everything possible for this, sometimes

29
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:03,060
even to the detriment of himself.

30
00:03:43,220 --> 00:03:47,240
- The Lord! Council of Workers' Deputies

31
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:51,120
Petersburg offers

32
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:55,220
to start a general strike. APPROVAL COUNTRIES

33
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,030
On January 9, we have already seen what your peaceful protest is worth.

34
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:08,030
Enough! Do you really think that your general strike will cope with their

35
00:04:08,050 --> 00:04:13,210
bayonets? We must act radically. -What are you offering?

36
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:19,130
-That the only thing a normal man can and should offer is -

37
00:04:19,150 --> 00:04:25,120
arm. Armed yourself, arm the workers. Urgently needed

38
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:30,070
deploy clandestine arms production. It is necessary to seize the printing press

39
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:34,170
and print leaflets calling for revolution. And then,

40
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:40,080
only then, we will be heard and will speak on equal terms.

41
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:44,110
-When you walk wide, Trotsky. So you can break your pants.

42
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:48,040
INNOVABLE AGES AGAINST THE TROTSKY

43
00:04:49,170 --> 00:04:55,120
"Comrades, the path of armed insurrection is not our way."

44
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:00,000
If you still do not understand this, Trotsky, you better leave the Council.

45
00:05:07,150 --> 00:05:10,110
INHOMOGENEOUS OBJECTS

46
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:23,180
-Why does it smell of sour cabbage everywhere, Dr. Gelfand?

47
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,220
-There smells like typographic paint. From the very childhood, I hate this smell.

48
00:05:28,060 --> 00:05:31,160
-Good God, tell me that I did not in vain come to this accursed city!

49
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:36,090
"I'm afraid you have nothing to please, Herr Kobert." As a member of the St. Petersburg

50
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,150
The Soviet of Workers' Deputies declare that this is a gathering of cripples and impotents.

51
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:44,140
-I heard that your pet Trotsky appeared in the city.

52
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,180
-Yes, he is rapidly gaining credibility in the working environment.

53
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:51,090
But we're not going to step on the same rake?

54
00:05:54,030 --> 00:05:59,230
-Do you know what the revolution did not have on January 9? Sacred sacrifice.

55
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
Togo, with whose name on their lips people would go overthrow the regime.

56
00:06:10,090 --> 00:06:15,010
- Do you think that Trotsky will approach the role of such a victim?

57
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:20,020
-Why not? You yourself say, people love him.

58
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:26,130
He is young, hot, smart. "Why should the gendarmes kill Trotsky?"

59
00:06:26,150 --> 00:06:29,090
Arrest and reference? As usual?

60
00:06:32,090 --> 00:06:35,240
"Who told you that the gendarmes would kill him?"

61
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:45,220
"Do you want me to kill him?"

62
00:06:50,130 --> 00:06:55,050
It's impossible. -How much do you want for this job?

63
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:02,130
Hold it. This is your 30 pieces of silver.

64
00:07:03,200 --> 00:07:07,080
Hold, do not be afraid. We do all the dirty work ourselves.

65
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:11,020
Your task is to make in the shortest possible time so that in this city

66
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:15,070
every dog ​​knew about Trotsky. All the rest is not your business.

67
00:07:24,090 --> 00:07:28,010
-Yes, we are so. It was necessary to enlist the support of the Council.

68
00:07:28,030 --> 00:07:32,080
-The Council is a pitiful bone, which they left us to talk,

69
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:36,180
to bring the revolution to nothing. Until we take matters into our own hands,

70
00:07:36,200 --> 00:07:41,030
nothing will be achieved. The revolution is like a woman:

71
00:07:41,050 --> 00:07:48,030
showed weakness or indifference - and she will leave. Therefore, we need strength,

72
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,100
an armed worker is needed ...

73
00:08:00,040 --> 00:08:02,050
-Our. Come on.

74
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:08,070
-Stand! Who are they?! Hands up to see!

75
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,150
Search.

76
00:08:21,180 --> 00:08:23,010
-We're leaving.

77
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,240
Flyers:

78
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:27,230
-To arrest.

79
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:32,170
You fool!

80
00:08:38,190 --> 00:08:40,040
-Walim!

81
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:03,070
-The entire circulation of leaflets was seized by gendarmes. One comrade was killed. Now

82
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:09,190
all printing houses will be guarded. -No trouble. We just started.

83
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:14,140
A month ago we did not have this. -You do not understand? Now Russia -

84
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,010
as an apothecary balance. On whether the workers will support us,

85
00:09:20,030 --> 00:09:23,000
it depends which cup will outweigh.

86
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:32,080
We need thousands of leaflets, tens of thousands. We need a newspaper.

87
00:09:39,220 --> 00:09:42,050
- Leo, look at me.

88
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,140
Look at me.

89
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:53,080
I fell in love with a man who does not fall for difficulties.

90
00:09:54,140 --> 00:10:01,070
I'm not going to be disappointed. My man does not back down and does not give up.

91
00:10:01,220 --> 00:10:08,070
He always wins. And you are my lion, and no one will stop you.

92
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:59,040
-I will not take money from the Germans. This is the logic of the victim.

93
00:10:59,060 --> 00:11:01,070
They want to use me.

94
00:11:03,140 --> 00:11:05,160
But you are not a victim, Trotsky, you are an aggressor.

95
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:09,140
"That's why I will not let anyone manipulate myself."

96
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,040
-Let's look at this from the other side. Where, if not in Germany,

97
00:11:13,060 --> 00:11:18,070
will they catch the "flame of the Russian revolution"? They want to use you,

98
00:11:18,090 --> 00:11:22,030
and you use them. Take money from them and at their own expense show

99
00:11:22,050 --> 00:11:27,050
an example of a revolution by the German workers. -I see you principles

100
00:11:27,070 --> 00:11:31,140
and have not acquired. -Principles hinder commerce.

101
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:35,110
Do you need a rostrum? I have everything - money, communications, newspaper,

102
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:38,230
which will provide you with this rostrum. Deal?

103
00:11:42,140 --> 00:11:48,120
-I want you to know. You are deeply unpleasant to me.

104
00:11:49,160 --> 00:11:55,000
-l'll outlive this. Tomorrow morning in the editorial office of our newspaper.

105
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,140
The proletariat must not only appeal to the revolution, but, above all,

106
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,150
himself to go to her. The revolution can not be appointed for a certain day, hour,

107
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:14,000
as a demonstration. No people have ever committed a revolution

108
00:12:14,020 --> 00:12:19,110
on the team. But due to the inevitably growing catastrophe, it is necessary

109
00:12:19,130 --> 00:12:23,200
already now determine the most successful positions, arm,

110
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:28,150
inspire masses with a revolutionary slogan, exercise them in combat

111
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:33,060
art, keep under arms, so that at the right moment

112
00:12:33,080 --> 00:12:39,040
hit the entire line with alarm. The revolutionary proletarian mass

113
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:45,070
there is. It is necessary to have a one-time skill in the entire space of Russia

114
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:49,200
to bring this mass to the streets and unite with a common cry.

115
00:12:52,220 --> 00:12:54,160
18 Toch

116
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:02,220
- Trainers Thomson and Khodashevich!

117
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:05,120
Clowns of Turov! ..

118

FOLK MUSIC

119
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,040
-Davno you were not visible, David Leontyevich.

120
00:13:24,060 --> 00:13:28,060
-So not a boy, so that 30 miles to and fro ...

121
00:13:28,080 --> 00:13:32,050
And now would not have come, and granddaughters asked them to show the city.

122
00:13:32,070 --> 00:13:36,030
- I'm Petrushka! Do you have a millet seed?

123
00:13:36,050 --> 00:13:38,020
-No. -I have.

124
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:43,180
- "Through the arming of the working class and revolutionary violence

125
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:49,040
to a just world of universal equality at the cost of the greatest

126
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:54,180
self-sacrifice. The blood of our best sons was bought by our motherland

127
00:13:54,200 --> 00:13:58,070
my freedom. "-This only give me rifles.

128
00:14:00,060 --> 00:14:04,070
-Well, are not you pleased, zhidyara? Harey did not come out?

129
00:14:04,090 --> 00:14:10,110
-All, that's all. The old Jew leaves. -I'm asking you!

130
00:14:19,020 --> 00:14:21,010
-Hey! Break off!

-Deda!

132
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:51,140
-You are my Zhidovochki, beauties ... Do not cry, do not cry.

133
00:14:51,160 --> 00:14:54,010
Well, go to your uncle.

134
00:14:55,220 --> 00:14:59,100
Go, sweetheart. He wants to see his grandfather!

135
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:06,140
Well look. Here is our grandfather. Yes? You want me not to beat my grandfather,

136
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:10,100
My fish? The girl wants. Well done.

137
00:15:10,120 --> 00:15:16,120
Well ... Then ... Eat then.

138
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:20,040
Eat.

139
00:15:20,060 --> 00:15:23,240
Eat, zhidovochka, beauty. Eat. Eat.

140
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:31,240
Eat. For the grandfather. More. I will not beat my grandfather back then.

141
00:15:32,180 --> 00:15:38,020
Here. " Well done. You see, now nobody touches your grandfather.

142
00:15:40,220 --> 00:15:45,010
-Come to me. Come to me.

... the dove.

157
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,210
- I'm not going either.

158
00:18:08,030 --> 00:18:12,140
Let's go with my father and take a walk. -Now?

159
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,160
-Well, why not? At night the capital shows its true face.

160
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,210
You did not like my Natasha? -I did not come to her, but to you.

161
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,080
LOUDLE LAUGHTER BACK

162
00:18:36,160 --> 00:18:40,240
You can not imagine what a terrible beast ...

163
00:18:41,010 --> 00:18:45,000
-What? Go, go. -... you release to freedom.

164
00:18:45,100 --> 00:18:49,160
This is a dark force, terrible. You do not have time to look back, as she

165
00:18:49,180 --> 00:18:53,020
will swallow up everything and everyone, and then you yourself.

166
00:18:53,040 --> 00:18:57,160
- Father, well, do not, you do not understand anything about it. The future is ours.

167
00:18:57,180 --> 00:18:59,220
And it's not as dark as it seems to you.

168
00:18:59,240 --> 00:19:05,150
"Damn it, I'm your father!" Do not dare with me as ... with these of your own.

169
00:19:05,170 --> 00:19:10,190
Do not kindle a fire, son, it's a hell fire, diabolical.

170
00:19:10,210 --> 00:19:15,070
Do not inflate it. -You know, I do not believe

171
00:19:15,090 --> 00:19:20,070
neither in God, nor in the devil. The course of history can not be stopped.

172
00:19:20,090 --> 00:19:22,180
Impossible. - They almost killed your daughter,

173
00:19:22,200 --> 00:19:25,190
and you want to give them weapons. -I'm sorry you had to

174
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:29,010
it's to survive ... -You wake up, Leiba! Look Back

175
00:19:29,030 --> 00:19:34,190
around! This is your new world - he is all this and will never be another.

176
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,080
Do you want to sacrifice your children for these bastards?

177
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:46,080
-Yes. I will sacrifice them. And I will sacrifice my wife. And you. And myself.

178
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,220
Polmira prayed to the one who gave his life for their sins,

179
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:57,010
but they themselves are not able to sacrifice a fraction of their philistine happiness.

180
00:19:57,030 --> 00:20:01,050
And I'm ready. I can. I can. Clear?

181
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:07,080
-You are not human, Leiba. You...

182
00:20:09,140 --> 00:20:15,140
... you are not my son anymore. I ... curse you.

183
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,080
-You finally said it out loud. You cursed me back then,

184
00:20:21,100 --> 00:20:25,140
when I left the gymnasium, right? You never believed in me.

185
00:20:25,160 --> 00:20:30,120
And I'll prove to you that I'm right! And no one will stop me.

186
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:49,150
-I do not even know what to say. It is one thing to consider construction

187
00:20:49,170 --> 00:20:54,120
material history of other people's lives. It's immoral, but at least explainable.

188
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,240
But be prepared to knowingly sacrifice one's own

189
00:20:58,010 --> 00:21:00,010
relatives, family ...

190
00:21:01,110 --> 00:21:04,170
-Aperitif. -And if you were offered to head

191
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:08,130
The Soviet Union in exchange for the life of Natalia Ivanovna?

192
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:14,180
-Natalya Ivanovna would be the first to offer such a choice.

193
00:21:17,130 --> 00:21:21,160
Oh, my God, do not look at me like that, Frank. On this way, I lost

194
00:21:21,180 --> 00:21:25,190
two children. The worst thing has happened to me already.

195
00:21:27,190 --> 00:21:30,200
We have one more problem, Lev. -What?

196
00:21:30,220 --> 00:21:33,080
-The cook refuses to go to work.

197
00:21:33,100 --> 00:21:38,130
-So ... Let me guess. Infectiousness - violence?

198
00:21:38,150 --> 00:21:40,170
-Yeah. -Clear.

199
00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:49,080
The aperitif is transferred. Frank, do you know how to score rabbits?

200
00:21:49,240 --> 00:21:52,190
-It was not necessary. -And I was taught in childhood.

201
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:57,240
My father taught me. Come with me. If you are not afraid of blood.

202
00:22:02,090 --> 00:22:05,240
-This strike should grow into something more.

203
00:22:06,010 --> 00:22:09,230
-Yes, but the masses are not ready yet. We just started rocking the boat.

204
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:12,180
And then, the weapon ... Without it, you yourself understand ...

205
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:17,000
"Damn your boat and your people!" The economy of Europe is bursting at the seams.

206
00:22:17,020 --> 00:22:21,010
Including Germany. We require urgent action.

207
00:22:21,030 --> 00:22:24,070
If something goes wrong, I promise you that our

208
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:28,050
cooperation is immediately recognized by your revolutionary friends.

209
00:22:31,220 --> 00:22:33,130
Stop it!

210
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,230
{601}{}{Go on.}

211
00:22:48,070 --> 00:22:52,200
-I say "No". No, I will not lead the people now at bayonets.

212
00:22:52,220 --> 00:22:57,010
We have just brought a call for weapons to the workers.

213
00:22:57,230 --> 00:23:02,000
-Hell! The Universal Strike. Another reason to withdraw at one time

214
00:23:02,020 --> 00:23:05,090
in one place such an amount of embittered people we have

215
00:23:05,110 --> 00:23:09,130
may not be. -You know how much you can make

216
00:23:09,150 --> 00:23:14,040
illegally, for one night shift at the Putilov factory?

217
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:20,050
Three. Only three, Parvus, one of which (at best) will be

218
00:23:20,070 --> 00:23:22,170
shoot. It's a drop in the ocean. We need time.

219
00:23:22,190 --> 00:23:28,170
-People's anger - a resource exhausted, Lev Davidovich. It ends,

220
00:23:28,190 --> 00:23:33,160
melts, as well as the generosity of my patrons.

221
00:23:38,090 --> 00:23:43,190
-You know what? Go to hell with your patrons.

222
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,010
So tell them.

223
00:24:03,220 --> 00:24:07,230
-I'm not restful. I'm always afraid for you. Stupid?

224
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:13,080
-You knew what kind of life I was living. -It's not about you.

225
00:24:14,140 --> 00:24:16,100
I do not believe Parvus.

226
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:24,080
-This is normal. No one believes him. -Yes. But the paradox is that he is right.

227
00:24:24,100 --> 00:24:29,140
If I see it, then others - even more so. The revolution will either come to naught,

228
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:33,140
or it will be headed by scoundrels and businessmen like Parvus.

229
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,140
I'm afraid to tell you this, but ...

230
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,040
- What is "but"?

231
00:24:46,060 --> 00:24:48,150
- Do not give it to her.

232
00:24:50,150 --> 00:24:52,190
This is your revolution.

233
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:57,200
-What? What happened to you?

234
00:25:00,140 --> 00:25:04,040
-Nothing. I'm just tired.

235
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,100
STRONG VOMITING

236
00:25:38,240 --> 00:25:43,170
-So, come on, buddy. Today it's your turn.

237
00:25:46,010 --> 00:25:49,060
-Before, I do not understand why you started the conversation

238
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:53,110
about the year 1905. That revolution you mediocre lost.

239
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:55,200
Justify the subsequent victims?

240
00:25:56,000 --> 00:26:02,030
- I've lost, yes. And this was the right decision. Painful, humiliating,

241
00:26:02,050 --> 00:26:04,070
but the only correct one.

242
00:26:05,030 --> 00:26:09,100
Then, in 1905, I was between a hammer and an anvil.

243
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:15,180
One force craved my death physical, the other was smarter -

244
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,000
accordingly, more terrible. Allow.

245
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:31,160
-My generals pull hair from each other, arguing about what to do

246
00:26:31,180 --> 00:26:34,120
with these fucking revolutionaries.

247
00:26:35,000 --> 00:26:39,040
Some shout: "Pour the country in blood," others propose to negotiate,

248
00:26:39,060 --> 00:26:43,080
they say, the economy will not survive slaughter. While they argue, the humble governor

249
00:26:43,100 --> 00:26:47,140
Saratov managed to curb the revolutionary mood in his entrusted care

250
00:26:47,160 --> 00:26:52,040
city. -For me it is an honor to serve the Fatherland,

251
00:26:52,060 --> 00:26:54,240
Your Majesty. -It is probable, you know what,

252
00:26:55,010 --> 00:26:58,080
that is unknown to my generals, Lord Stolypin.

253
00:26:58,230 --> 00:27:03,090
Share the recipe? -Good whip, if it's wiped with the mind.

254
00:27:03,130 --> 00:27:07,070
Here Alexander Nevsky, for example, did not attack the enemy, but allowed

255
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:10,240
Teutons themselves get out on the weak ice. And they went to the bottom under the weight

256
00:27:11,010 --> 00:27:13,080
their armor. -I invited you here,

257
00:27:13,100 --> 00:27:16,170
Petr Arkadevich, not in order to speak in riddles.

258
00:27:16,190 --> 00:27:20,160
"I beg your pardon, Your Majesty." I wanted to say that with the rebels,

259
00:27:20,180 --> 00:27:24,090
in my opinion, it is necessary to act in the same way as Nevsky

260
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:28,020
entered with the Teutons: let them act as they want.

261
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:32,170
Do not shoot them like January 9, but force them to shed their own blood.

262
00:27:32,190 --> 00:27:36,000
It will forever compromise the revolution and its leaders

263
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,190
in the eyes of the people.

264
00:27:39,150 --> 00:27:42,180
"And if they do not want to shed blood?"

265
00:27:42,200 --> 00:27:46,000
-On this occasion in their crowd there will always be our people dressed up

266
00:27:46,020 --> 00:27:49,140
in the workers. They will open fire on the troops, thereby force

267
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:54,160
soldiers to retaliatory actions. All the blame for the spilled blood will fall down

268
00:27:54,180 --> 00:27:58,040
on the revolutionaries, and not on the courtyard, Your Majesty.

269
00:28:06,230 --> 00:28:08,140
-All a strike!

270
00:28:09,060 --> 00:28:11,160
All for a manifestation!

271
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,010
Let the one who is afraid hide!

272
00:28:15,030 --> 00:28:19,200
- Comrades! The laws of criminal power are criminal laws.

273
00:28:20,030 --> 00:28:23,000
-Correctly! -The culprit can not and will not be

274
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:26,070
dictate to us how to live! -No! Will not be!

275
00:28:26,130 --> 00:28:29,000
- Let them hear your voice ... - Yes!

276
00:28:29,090 --> 00:28:31,200
-... See your power! -Yes!

277
00:28:31,220 --> 00:28:34,200
- Let them tremble with fear! -Yes!

278
00:28:35,050 --> 00:28:37,020
-All on the manifesto!

279
00:28:43,090 --> 00:28:44,230
CROWN CROWD

280
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:19,230
It has begun ...

281
00:29:24,090 --> 00:29:26,000
Report back to the emperor.

282
00:29:26,190 --> 00:29:30,050
It is urgently necessary to convene a meeting in the government.

283
00:29:38,200 --> 00:29:42,110
So our turn came, Sergey Sergeevich.

284
00:29:49,070 --> 00:29:52,230
Act decisively, but without too much publicity.

285
00:29:57,020 --> 00:29:58,120
- Grow up!

286
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,070
Live, live!

287
00:30:05,060 --> 00:30:06,130
Go.

288
00:30:19,100 --> 00:30:20,230
-You're scared?

289
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:26,240
-Late for fear. There is no way back.

290
00:30:30,150 --> 00:30:32,230
-And I'm afraid.

291
00:30:35,090 --> 00:30:38,010
I'm afraid to see for the first time how people die.

292
00:30:40,170 --> 00:30:44,190
-Do not be afraid of death. Especially when she ...

293
00:30:46,220 --> 00:30:48,230
is justified by history.

294
00:30:49,170 --> 00:30:55,010
In any case, after this day, the world will never be the same.

295
00:30:55,220 --> 00:31:00,000
-Yes I know. Our children will live in a different world.

296
00:31:01,090 --> 00:31:04,060
I would not want it to start with blood.

297
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:10,050
"Natasha, I think you'd better leave town." Just in case.

298
00:31:11,040 --> 00:31:14,220
- I'm not going anywhere. And no matter what happens, I'll stay close

299
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:16,050
with you. -Nata!

300
00:31:16,070 --> 00:31:20,150
- Leo, do not even start. You know that yours does not work for me

301
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:22,000
oratory.

302
00:31:22,240 --> 00:31:30,210
In addition, we agreed that I decide everything on my own.

303
00:31:38,210 --> 00:31:41,140
THE CROWD SCANDING THE SLOGANS

304
00:31:49,060 --> 00:31:53,220
-The power of the fucking factory owners and politicians!

305
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:56,180
CROWD: Out! Down with!

306
00:31:58,020 --> 00:32:04,130
"Long live the power of the workers!" "Long live the power of the workers!"

307
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:11,100
-Ise the forged gendarme's forged boot from the chest of the working people!

308
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,010
-We'll! Skin!

309
00:32:16,140 --> 00:32:19,120
-Nahans ahead of time do not shine.

310
00:32:19,140 --> 00:32:26,000
Puso to draw in. Do not sniff with your eyes, otherwise this brother will see you in a moment.

311
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:31,000
And the main thing is to shoot no sooner than they reach the square.

312
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:35,020
CROWD: Skin! Skin!

313
00:32:35,040 --> 00:32:40,110
- Feel, Trotsky? It's your day! Your story, your revolution!

314
00:32:40,130 --> 00:32:43,180
CROWD: Skin! Skin!

315
00:32:44,140 --> 00:32:48,200
GERMAN: Do not rush. He must die at the maximum of witnesses.

316
00:32:48,220 --> 00:32:51,090
Beware of the tsarist police.

317
00:33:22,200 --> 00:33:25,190
-Trotsky, why did we stop? Just do not say,

318
00:33:25,210 --> 00:33:27,070
that you were frightened.

319
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:34,000
- There will be a massacre. - Hell with him! You yourself wanted it.

320
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:37,140
You achieved this. Do you stop at the moment when

321
00:33:37,160 --> 00:33:39,210
before the revolution is one step left? Trotsky!

322
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,150
"Let Trotsky say!"

323
00:34:13,050 --> 00:34:17,210
CROWD: Trotsky! Trotsky!

324
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,000
The phone rings.

325
00:34:33,070 --> 00:34:36,180
-The manifestation came to the Palace Square.

326
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:40,010
-Take care of Trotsky.

327
00:34:40,190 --> 00:34:43,070
No hair should fall from his head.

328
00:34:44,070 --> 00:34:47,180
Check everything again, especially lofts and roofs.

329
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:53,030
CROWD: Trotsky! Trotsky!

330
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:09,010
CROWD SHRINKS

331
00:35:09,030 --> 00:35:14,100
- Comrades! We came to the ruling gang on the chest!

332
00:35:14,120 --> 00:35:19,030
They promised us freedom, electoral rights,

333
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,010
legislative power. And where, where is all this?

334
00:35:24,170 --> 00:35:28,150
Is there faith after that? CROWD: No!

335
00:35:30,070 --> 00:35:36,090
-Nicholas II began his reign with the fact that he thanked

336
00:35:36,110 --> 00:35:41,180
grenadiers for the murder of Yaroslavl workers. Such as you.

337
00:35:42,050 --> 00:35:47,010
And now he made Bloody Sunday himself.

338
00:35:47,030 --> 00:35:51,200
For him, Russia is a street girl, with whom one can do everything

339
00:35:51,220 --> 00:35:56,040
for insignificant handouts. Is there faith after that?

340
00:35:56,060 --> 00:36:00,020
CROWD: No! No!

341
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:06,050
- Look around! Has anything changed since yesterday?

342
00:36:06,070 --> 00:36:07,190
CROWD: No!

343
00:36:07,210 --> 00:36:11,140
-Did the gate of prisons open? -No!

344
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:17,010
-We still hear moaning and gnashing of teeth due to these

345
00:36:17,030 --> 00:36:23,040
damned walls! Have our brothers returned from their exile to their homes?

346
00:36:23,130 --> 00:36:24,220
"No.

347
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:32,170
-Nikolay II and his gold-rutted singers consider themselves

348
00:36:32,190 --> 00:36:40,180
salt of the earth, and you - obtuse obedient cattle, gears of their full,

349
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:43,010
littered with the blessings of life.

350
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:46,090
But no, they are wrong!

351
00:36:46,110 --> 00:36:50,220
It's you - the salt of the earth!

352
00:36:50,240 --> 00:36:54,150
-Yes! Hooray!

353
00:36:59,180 --> 00:37:00,200
-To arrest!

354
00:37:07,190 --> 00:37:11,100
-Why did you stop talking? Continue!

355
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:21,100
-Now they want us to go with our bare hands

356
00:37:21,120 --> 00:37:23,110
on their bayonets!

357
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:30,240
They want to repeat Bloody Sunday again, drown our

358
00:37:31,010 --> 00:37:34,240
revolution in her own blood.

359
00:37:35,150 --> 00:37:37,230
But this will not happen!

360
00:37:38,000 --> 00:37:42,040
Our life belongs to us and only to us!

361
00:37:42,060 --> 00:37:46,190
And we will not give it away for snuff tobacco!

362
00:37:47,070 --> 00:37:50,010
We will choose another way!

363
00:37:51,010 --> 00:37:58,030
And they, I tell you, they will pay very dearly

364
00:37:58,050 --> 00:38:00,030
for the blood of our brothers.

365
00:38:00,050 --> 00:38:02,000
"Yes."

366
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:07,120
- Comrades! We go home!

367
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:10,020
-What are you doing? What are you doing?!

368
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:11,180
-We are!

369
00:38:11,200 --> 00:38:13,150
DISAPPOINTED GUL

370
00:38:50,140 --> 00:38:52,150
-You made the right choice.

371
00:38:54,040 --> 00:38:56,030
-Because of the bloodless?

372
00:38:57,180 --> 00:38:59,120
-Because it's yours.

373
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:08,240
-The area is free. The crowd dispersed without a single shot.

374
00:39:10,170 --> 00:39:14,240
-How did you split up? What the hell?

375
00:39:15,010 --> 00:39:18,120
And Trotsky? -Well ... You yourself said that ...

376
00:39:19,100 --> 00:39:23,020
- Arrest him immediately! -Listen!

377
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:24,220
-Immediately!

378
00:39:38,220 --> 00:39:40,180
-Stopkin Stolypin ... -That you?

379
00:39:40,200 --> 00:39:43,080
-Right, I'm uncomfortable every time to remind ...

380
00:39:43,100 --> 00:39:46,150
-Do not bother. I spoke about you at the treasury. Come on,

381
00:39:46,180 --> 00:39:49,110
you will write a check. -I hope now in St. Petersburg

382
00:39:49,130 --> 00:39:52,030
with the German spy network over?

383
00:39:52,130 --> 00:39:54,060
-I hope so.

384
00:39:54,080 --> 00:39:57,040
Sorry, I have a lot to do.

385
00:39:57,240 --> 00:40:02,220
And further. As soon as you get a check, get out of Russia.

386
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:04,140
It's been my honor...

387
00:40:05,140 --> 00:40:07,040
-Excellent.

388
00:40:17,140 --> 00:40:19,010
-Leave us out!

389
00:40:40,170 --> 00:40:42,130
-Who are you?

390
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:48,170
-That, to whom, let's say, was instructed to restore order in the country.

391
00:40:51,240 --> 00:40:55,100
- For that, you were ready to kill hundreds of people.

392
00:40:56,130 --> 00:40:58,210
I wonder how you sleep at night?

393
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:02,070
- I'm not complaining about sleep.

394
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:05,090
You see, what's the matter ...

395
00:41:06,200 --> 00:41:11,040
I'm ready to make sacrifices, but only when absolutely necessary.

396
00:41:11,060 --> 00:41:14,110
But she was not there. - Stop lying.

397
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:18,120
Why then did you need to transfer troops to the city?

398
00:41:19,070 --> 00:41:22,210
-It was necessary to be ready for any options.

399
00:41:23,190 --> 00:41:28,080
I'm a pragmatist. The revolution will happen sooner or later.

400
00:41:28,100 --> 00:41:30,210
I won the time.

401
00:41:30,230 --> 00:41:35,060
And I will do everything possible to make the revolution bloodless.

402
00:41:36,020 --> 00:41:38,100
-And here you miscalculated.

403
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:42,180
We will return and destroy you all.

404
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,180
-You do not understand one thing.

405
00:41:48,060 --> 00:41:53,150
Any religion implicated in blood is a monster, which sooner or later

406
00:41:53,170 --> 00:42:00,160
devours their own children. You think, feed him to us - and he will calm down?

407
00:42:03,000 --> 00:42:04,140
No.

408
00:42:06,110 --> 00:42:09,050
Think about it at leisure.

409
00:42:11,150 --> 00:42:14,220
I was glad to get acquainted personally.

410
00:42:25,190 --> 00:42:29,240
-Do not reflect like that, Jackson. It's not a rabbit anymore, it's a piece of meat.

411
00:42:31,160 --> 00:42:35,010
Want some water? -Everything is fine. Let's get better

412
00:42:35,030 --> 00:42:37,020
we will talk about you. -Let's.

413
00:42:37,040 --> 00:42:40,020
-Why did you change your mind and did not go to the assault?

414
00:42:40,040 --> 00:42:44,070
-In the world of the immaterial this is called the "sixth sense."

415
00:42:44,090 --> 00:42:47,090
-Take it, Trotsky! You do not believe in God.

416
00:42:47,160 --> 00:42:50,210
Why not admit the obvious - that you are banal coward.

417
00:42:50,230 --> 00:42:53,180
-Well, here's the obvious.

418
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:58,140
In 1905 the people were not ready for a revolution. There was no weapon,

419
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,200
there was no clear program of action, there was no support for the majority.

420
00:43:02,220 --> 00:43:06,090
Well and yes, yes, I was frightened.

421
00:43:06,110 --> 00:43:10,240
No, not prison, not death. I was scared of the very same ones

422
00:43:11,010 --> 00:43:15,220
useless victims, about which we have been talking with you since the morning.

423
00:43:17,000 --> 00:43:20,110
-All these are just words. Facts say the opposite.

424
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:26,170
-Good. Here is one more fact.

425
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:32,090
If then I was killed, then there would be no revolution.

426
00:43:32,110 --> 00:43:37,180
Do not you still understand that the revolution is me?

427
00:44:08,030 --> 00:44:10,210
Why did you get up? - So the coal is over.

428
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:14,100
I also reported to Comrade Sermuk near Kalyazin.

429
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:17,110
- Where am I going to get the coal for you? It was said: stock up the wood.

430
00:44:17,130 --> 00:44:22,180
-Where can I get some firewood? There is no forest. What will I be, stoking shops?

431
00:44:22,200 --> 00:44:27,150
- Yes, even with your oak head! You wanted a tribunal, vrazhina?

432
00:44:29,210 --> 00:44:32,070
"Collect people, Comrade Sermuk!"

433
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:36,020
Will you firewood.

434
00:44:56,020 --> 00:44:57,220
"Comrade Sermux!"

435
00:45:10,110 --> 00:45:11,200
-Herod!

436
00:45:12,070 --> 00:45:18,210
What are you doing? Immediately my son is buried! Atheists!

437
00:45:19,150 --> 00:45:22,150
There is no Christ for you! I'll kill you!

438
00:45:36,170 --> 00:45:38,100
-Dow!

439
00:45:44,190 --> 00:45:46,120
SHOES

440
00:46:21,140 --> 00:46:25,000
- Finish the loading - and go. In two hours there should be

441
00:46:25,020 --> 00:46:27,150
in Nikolaev. - Lev Davidovich!

442
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:30,200
With these what to do?

443
00:46:35,150 --> 00:46:37,110
- Let's go, let's go.

444
00:47:08,010 --> 00:47:12,230
Probably, it's hard to understand who never made sacrifices.

445
00:47:14,040 --> 00:47:18,000
-You forgot that I fought. This science is familiar to me no worse than you.

446
00:47:19,030 --> 00:47:21,140
Then why do not you eat?

447
00:47:22,180 --> 00:47:26,070
Everything is simple. We need to eat, right?

448
00:47:26,090 --> 00:47:30,210
For this, we killed a rabbit. That's all. This is a justified sacrifice.

449
00:47:31,230 --> 00:47:33,240
-This is different! -Mm!

450
00:47:35,160 --> 00:47:39,080
My life did not allow me to be like you.

451
00:47:39,100 --> 00:47:44,090
- What does it mean - like me? -The young fool who craves

452
00:47:44,110 --> 00:47:47,210
truth, but then he turns away when he sees her. Because the truth

453
00:47:47,230 --> 00:47:53,090
cruel, and you - a young man who is still dreaming about something.

454
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,190
-I am tired of tolerating your insults. If it were not for your age,

455
00:47:56,210 --> 00:47:59,060
I would ... - It's not an insult, it's true.

456
00:47:59,080 --> 00:48:02,100
If you do not like it, you can go to hell and more

457
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:04,010
not to return.

458
00:48:06,070 --> 00:48:09,230
-And you could not prove anything to me. Because in my world the truth is

459
00:48:10,000 --> 00:48:11,210
really ... -Natasha, spend it.

460
00:48:11,230 --> 00:48:15,060
-... and not what allows Leon Trotsky to find compromises

461
00:48:15,080 --> 00:48:17,100
with his conscience. -Take it!

462
00:48:23,130 --> 00:48:28,100
Father, why did you come? - Did not you call me?

463
00:48:33,150 --> 00:48:36,170
"Yes, I ... wanted to talk."

464
00:48:38,180 --> 00:48:40,140
- You have not changed much.

465
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:48,010
I remember when you were little, I dreamed that you would get

466
00:48:48,030 --> 00:48:52,080
education, graduate from university, will become a respected person.

467
00:48:52,100 --> 00:48:57,060
But you chose a different path, took yourself another name,

468
00:48:57,080 --> 00:49:00,240
and now in your heart is completely empty.

469
00:49:02,080 --> 00:49:06,130
This is bad. -I wanted to destroy the order,

470
00:49:06,150 --> 00:49:09,180
built on the inequalities of people.

471
00:49:11,050 --> 00:49:15,090
What's wrong with that? -And you asked people,

472
00:49:15,110 --> 00:49:17,190
Do they need it or not? A?

473
00:49:18,150 --> 00:49:20,060
He asked me?

474
00:49:21,020 --> 00:49:27,170
Son, I worked all my life: growing bread, building our house.

475
00:49:29,170 --> 00:49:33,000
And you dedicated your life to destruction.

476
00:49:34,190 --> 00:49:38,230
-I wanted to build for all people ...

477
00:49:39,100 --> 00:49:45,240
a world where justice and equality rule.

478
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:49,200
Sooner or later I will do it.

479
00:49:50,180 --> 00:49:54,020
And people will see ... -What kind of people are they?

480
00:49:54,190 --> 00:49:58,100
You're a Jew, Leiba. You'll never be your own for them.

481
00:49:59,010 --> 00:50:03,070
"Our drunk came from Dorogobuzh, and his mare

482
00:50:03,090 --> 00:50:07,220
nedyuzha. Piishov rabbi torture, sho with the mare to work.

483
00:50:07,240 --> 00:50:13,040
And the rabbi replies: "And you are her slaughter-you sing Koninushki."

484
00:50:13,060 --> 00:50:18,200
Eyes - no candles, guts - on books, and sho peed tail grew -

485
00:50:18,220 --> 00:50:22,010
so that the entire Jewish censor goes. "

486
00:50:39,010 --> 00:50:41,150
Farewell, Leiba.
