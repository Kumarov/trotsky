1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,200
OVER THE SUBTITLES WORKED: O. KULAGIN, Y. KARAVAN, S. ARTEMS, A. PRYAKH

2
00:00:15,220 --> 00:00:20,000
TERRIBLE LAUGHTER

3
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,100
-Sorry, Leiba.

4
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:42,140
Left

5
00:00:46,150 --> 00:00:48,080
You have a letter.

6
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:51,200
From Frida.

7
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:01,210
* It's stange...

8
00:01:04,200 --> 00:01:06,160
What does she want?

9
00:01:08,120 --> 00:01:12,230
"You did not allow me to paint your portrait.

10
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,190
I really miss my Lion. "

11
00:01:36,160 --> 00:01:41,100
FUNNY FOLK MUSIC

12
00:01:51,110 --> 00:01:56,140
"Comrade Trotsky!" Comrade Trotsky! And I'm waiting for you at the first car.

13
00:01:56,160 --> 00:02:00,090
I thought you were comfortable, and you are directly with the people.

14
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,150
Come along.

15
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:08,130
You stayed in your America, Comrade Trotsky.

16
00:02:08,150 --> 00:02:11,230
The whole revolution passed without you. -Revolution is just beginning.

17
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:14,070
-Here! And Comrade Lenin said the same thing.

18
00:02:14,090 --> 00:02:17,110
"I'm with you, peasant!" -It's only too bad, not all of our

19
00:02:17,130 --> 00:02:22,030
ideas permeated, Comrade Trotsky. -Your. I'm still non-partisan.

20
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:37,030
"Here, Comrade Trotsky." Your former and current apartment.

21
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:54,000
IN ENGLISH: Mom, tell me, why does he look at us like that?

22
00:02:54,020 --> 00:02:57,010
-Serezh, please speak Russian.

23
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,100
"Welcome back, Comrade Trotsky."

24
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:16,180
-In New York, the Negroes live like that. -After the revolution, no one

25
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,190
will not live, Lyova. -Where's the suitcase?

26
00:03:18,210 --> 00:03:20,130
- Carry that room.

27
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:40,210
-Hello! Can I see Mr. Trotsky?

28
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:43,240
-Hospodin asked me not to call.

29
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:47,220
"Alexander Kerensky would like to meet with you,

30
00:03:47,240 --> 00:03:50,210
Minister and Chairman of the Provisional Government.

31
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,070
"I understand that you are aware of that shaky dual power,

32
00:03:54,090 --> 00:03:59,020
which has now developed in Russia. -As I understand,

33
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,050
The Provisional Government is still subject to the army, the gendarmerie,

34
00:04:03,070 --> 00:04:08,210
The bourgeoisie loves and obeys you, but the working class does not pose a penny.

35
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:13,170
-Yes, you are absolutely right. The authority of the workers we, frankly,

36
00:04:13,190 --> 00:04:18,050
do not use. And therefore we have not the slightest opportunity to influence

37
00:04:18,070 --> 00:04:23,060
to strikes and stalemate movements. -This possibility exists

38
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,190
only the Soviet of Workers' Deputies. -Facts!

39
00:04:27,210 --> 00:04:32,140
Pretenders, dancing to the tune of this maniacal loon of Lenin, who

40
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,100
he does not think about anything except his own power. That is why any of our

41
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:39,140
initiatives. The Soviets boycotted and sabotaged.

42
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,130
-I apologize for interrupting you, Alexander Fedorovich.

43
00:04:43,150 --> 00:04:48,080
What do you want from me? -I read some of your works,

44
00:04:48,100 --> 00:04:52,050
Lev Davidovich, and I find you much wiser than Lenin. And wherein

45
00:04:52,070 --> 00:04:55,210
you are no less an authority among the workers.

46
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:00,040
We would like to enlist your help in order to rein in

47
00:05:00,060 --> 00:05:03,080
strike movement. -The point is that I arrived

48
00:05:03,100 --> 00:05:07,140
not to curb, but to lead a strike movement.

49
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:14,200
-Listen, Lev Davidovich, we all wanted a revolution. And now, when

50
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:18,120
the tsar abdicated, Russia has a chance - a chance to go differently,

51
00:05:18,140 --> 00:05:22,070
civilized, European way with democracy and parliamentary

52
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:24,220
republic. I lived in your Europe as an example

53
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,160
longer than you. I saw their democracy with the parliamentary republics ...

54
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,140
Pszyk is everything. There is no more freedom there than under tsarism.

55
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,230
"So you think unchecked chaos is more just?"

56
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,040
- Do you know what I think?

57
00:05:39,070 --> 00:05:44,030
I ... will sweep your whole world to hell.

58
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:47,180
I'll take power in Petrograd ...

59
00:05:48,220 --> 00:05:52,180
and finish the revolution. On a global scale.

60
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:59,160
Even if they tear me in half. And neither with you, nor with anyone else

61
00:05:59,180 --> 00:06:03,080
I'm not going to agree on anything.

62
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:15,080
- Lord, a moment of attention!

63
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:29,200
"As a minimum, Leon, one of us certainly does."

64
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,070
-You can? -We both saw my wife naked.

65
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,070
"Do not flatter it, boys. The whole world saw me naked.

66
00:06:39,230 --> 00:06:47,130
-Frank, come in, meet. This is Frida Kahlo and her husband Diego Rivera.

67
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:54,080
They are not only world famous artists, but also convinced

68
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:58,150
socialists. -You see, you were not mistaken again, Leon.

69
00:06:58,170 --> 00:07:01,030
-What? -He said that you have not yet outlived

70
00:07:01,050 --> 00:07:06,030
in himself philistine concepts of personal insults, but still run back

71
00:07:06,050 --> 00:07:10,050
in order to finish his business. I'm afraid the Seigneur Trotsky forgot

72
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:14,000
to mention that I do not put in a penny nine out of ten of his words.

73
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:18,040
This is the basis for our communication. -How is it?

74
00:07:18,220 --> 00:07:22,140
-I, I think I'll come back another time, when it will not be necessary to support

75
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:25,120
nobody's shock. -Choose, quit, comrade. let's

76
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:29,130
send this vicious woman to write a portrait of old Trotsky, and we are with you

77
00:07:29,150 --> 00:07:34,070
Let's drink this ambrosia. Sit down! -No! No, Frida. All this is nowhere

78
00:07:34,090 --> 00:07:37,020
not good. You will not write me in this.

79
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:40,080
-Leon, but this costume symbolizes a vicious aggression!

80
00:07:40,100 --> 00:07:44,200
Your soul is only bright colors! -I, as a materialist,

81
00:07:44,220 --> 00:07:49,120
I do not believe in any soul. -You just got used to dictating

82
00:07:49,140 --> 00:07:52,010
their conditions. And you never accept strangers.

83
00:07:52,030 --> 00:07:56,060
-Yes! It's always been like this. -That's why you never had

84
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,000
real companions. You could not work together even with Lenin.

85
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:05,050
-Lenin always envied me and was looking for any opportunity to take me away

86
00:08:05,070 --> 00:08:09,240
from the political field, and do it so as not to compromise

87
00:08:10,010 --> 00:08:12,030
himself before the Bolsheviks.

88
00:08:17,210 --> 00:08:20,240
-But despite the fact that Comrade Trotsky

89
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:23,240
not Bolshevik, our party intends to

90
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:28,230
recommend it to the executive committee of the Petrograd Soviet. I want to remind,

91
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,160
that Comrade Trotsky was a member of the Soviet of Workers' Deputies as far back as 1905.

92
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:40,230
A colossal experience. For many of us, Lev Davidovich almost became

93
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,050
not a symbol of the First Russian Revolution. But the main thing ... The main thing is that he

94
00:08:46,070 --> 00:08:51,060
is extremely authoritative among the working masses, and to neglect such

95
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:55,040
authority, comrades, on our part it would be at least

96
00:08:55,060 --> 00:09:00,130
unreasonable. So, comrades, I propose to vote. Who for that,

97
00:09:00,150 --> 00:09:05,170
that Comrade Trotsky should join the Executive Committee of the Petrograd Soviet?

98
00:09:16,020 --> 00:09:17,190
Hello

99
00:09:23,130 --> 00:09:25,060
SCHOOL BELL

100
00:09:31,030 --> 00:09:33,070
-You are parrot! -Hose is hunchbacked!

101
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:35,200
-How much time? -Two Jews.

102
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:40,050
-Mary Pavlovna, thank you.

103
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,050
-Hello. -No bread.

104
00:09:50,210 --> 00:09:53,090
-Wait, but here's the woman just ...

105
00:09:53,110 --> 00:09:56,170
-It was just. And no more.

106
00:10:04,210 --> 00:10:07,100
"So, comrades, who is against?"

107
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:19,050
-Serge! Come on, get away from him! - Leo! Seryozha!

108
00:10:19,070 --> 00:10:21,160
-Go away, I told you!

109
00:10:22,220 --> 00:10:24,160
- Where's the cap?

110
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:39,080
-Thank you, comrades.

111
00:10:42,170 --> 00:10:48,210
-Fuckers Lenin! Smokes incense to me, and his clerks at the same time

112
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:55,000
they compromise me. Thank you. Afraid that I will take his power from him.

113
00:10:55,020 --> 00:10:59,160
But there is no open conflict, because workers love me.

114
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:05,030
-The boys were again harassed at the gymnasium.

115
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,130
SPEAK ON GERMAN

116
00:11:09,150 --> 00:11:12,230
I now think: maybe it was not worth contacting the Bolsheviks?

117
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,170
Around so much hatred. -Bolsheviks are popular among workers.

118
00:11:16,190 --> 00:11:20,240
- There are no workers in the gymnasium. There are children of shopkeepers and merchants.

119
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:24,160
-When I take power, there will be neither shopkeepers nor merchants.

120
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:26,230
-And bread was not given again today.

121
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:05,030
You know, Lyova, until everything settles ... Here.

122
00:12:28,170 --> 00:12:31,160
-Tike-so ... -Leon, stop clowning.

123
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:34,230
Otherwise, I will never finish your portrait. And I do not have much

124
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,170
time. Leon! -When did you start to worry about this?

125
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:45,060
time? You did not come to write my portrait, did you? True?

126
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,220
"You're a funny man, Rivera." -What do you have in mind?

127
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,110
"I heard that three years ago you sheltered Trotsky at your dacha,

128
00:12:57,130 --> 00:13:00,210
slept with your wife instead of gratitude.

129
00:13:00,230 --> 00:13:05,000
Of course, I do not believe the rumors, but ... -Love, like talent, can not

130
00:13:05,020 --> 00:13:08,200
belong only to man. "So Trotsky betrayed you,

131
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:12,060
and you bring your woman to him on a date?

132
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:16,010
- Senor Jackson! You look so serious ...

133
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:18,200
What are you arguing about? -We discuss with your husband

134
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:21,130
concept of betrayal. -Ah! ..

135
00:13:21,150 --> 00:13:24,210
-He argues that this is something philistine and almost

136
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:27,080
not bourgeois. - Very simple, Jackson.

137
00:13:27,100 --> 00:13:31,190
In the absence of private property in a narrow sense and accessibility

138
00:13:31,210 --> 00:13:37,230
all and all things are canceled and the reflexes of the owner.

139
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,100
And therefore, betrayal is impossible. -The world I dream about,

140
00:13:42,120 --> 00:13:45,230
does not abolish the concept of fidelity. -Bravo! Bravo!

141
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:50,220
-Well, if the term fidelity makes you laugh, but betrayal

142
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:54,200
you ascribe to bourgeois prejudices, tell us ...

143
00:13:54,220 --> 00:13:57,030
about Nikolay Markin.

144
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:05,190
- Who is this Markin, Leon? - A man from the past. One of many.

145
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,120
Hello!

146
00:14:18,060 --> 00:14:19,160
So...

147
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,090
Uh-huh.

148
00:14:23,190 --> 00:14:28,160
What do I have to say to this ... I will give you 25 rubles for it.

149
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:32,100
And if you strongly ask me, then even 26 rubles.

150
00:14:32,120 --> 00:14:35,200
No, I do not argue, you can go to Mendel at Liteiny,

151
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:40,040
to hear there the price of 22 rubles and again to return to Usharovich.

152
00:14:42,070 --> 00:14:43,140
- Give me the money.

153
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,120
-Hi from the old shtiblet! -Kolya! Why do not you come in?

154
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:50,180
I already started to be afraid for you. Faya, what are you standing there for? Kolya has come.

155
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,190
"And do not be afraid for us, uncle of the Jew." You know, we are all with honor,

156
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,160
in conscience, in justice.

157
00:15:01,180 --> 00:15:04,110
Everybody is here? - It's exactly like in a drugstore, Kolya.

158
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:06,230
-Oh well, you can breathe smoothly.

159
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:10,210
Come on.

160
00:15:13,220 --> 00:15:17,200
-All fear is lost, bastards. -I beg you, Faya. But we have

161
00:15:17,220 --> 00:15:22,010
order on the street. No one will do it the way we did

162
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:28,050
Feldman with Shpalernaya, who came and was killed. Here are your 26 rubles.

163
00:15:28,190 --> 00:15:34,000
Usharovich never deceives anyone, even when he is robbed.

164
00:16:08,150 --> 00:16:10,080
-Release.

165
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:22,210
Do not bother, uncle!

166
00:16:30,190 --> 00:16:32,130
Now pick it up.

167
00:16:41,150 --> 00:16:43,210
-Ah, shantrap!

168
00:16:43,230 --> 00:16:47,230
Get lost, do you? - Brothers, brothers! What business?

169
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,230
We can share it. - This is my territory, brother.

170
00:17:11,200 --> 00:17:13,210
STONES

171
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:21,080
And that trembling knees? Come on, go pick up the money.

172
00:17:21,100 --> 00:17:25,030
Usharovich chew. The second will no longer give. Come on, come on.

173
00:17:32,050 --> 00:17:35,100
-Thank you. -And thank you, you will not be healthy.

174
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,210
Five rubles from you - a brother to take a walk.

175
00:17:38,230 --> 00:17:40,120
Now

176
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,180
-Well, wait a minute.

177
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:53,000
You ... cho? And this is exactly yours?

178
00:17:54,150 --> 00:17:59,150
You Cho, Trotsky, or what? Brothers, this is ... Trotsky! Here you go.

179
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,180
Sorry friend. I did not recognize you at once. Comrade Trotsky, can I help you?

180
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:09,110
hand shake? Oh please. Kolya I'm Markin. Leva!

181
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:13,080
Yes, I'm on your articles grew! You write business, business!

182
00:18:13,100 --> 00:18:17,100
You are my good! How is it there? .. The dictatorship of the proletariat, that everything

183
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,110
in honor, in conscience, in justice, yes?

184
00:18:22,030 --> 00:18:24,000
Only it is bad that you are a Jew.

185
00:18:27,130 --> 00:18:32,080
-After the revolution there will be neither Russians nor Jews ...

186
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:35,170
Comrade Markin, there will not be.

187
00:18:36,200 --> 00:18:39,120
-And why are you offended? No offense. I did it with love.

188
00:18:39,140 --> 00:18:42,180
Here is a Jew, but such a human!

189
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:46,170
Come on, you cho. Take it.

190
00:18:47,130 --> 00:18:52,060
You, this, if necessary, you say.

191
00:18:56,230 --> 00:18:58,200
Thank you

192
00:19:05,180 --> 00:19:07,210
-Get off!

193
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:11,080
What do you mean, do not you understand? Get away from him!

194
00:19:13,010 --> 00:19:15,050
Do not you understand that?

195
00:19:29,000 --> 00:19:32,060
-Well, I do not have a free space. Well, how much to say?

196
00:19:33,060 --> 00:19:34,160
Go ahead.

197
00:19:34,180 --> 00:19:36,150
Hello, Natalia Ivanovna!

198
00:19:37,110 --> 00:19:40,060
You've been missed the last time.

199
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,160
Here you are for past rations and tepericha.

200
00:19:43,180 --> 00:19:47,140
Why did not you immediately say that you are leading your friendship with Nikolai Grigorievich?

201
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:52,120
-Kronstadt revolutionary sailors

202
00:19:52,140 --> 00:19:54,140
express full trust

203
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:55,240
Comrade Trotsky.

204
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:04,060
And we demand that the hero of 1905 become a member of the Petrograd Soviet

205
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,040
workers and peasants' deputies.

206
00:20:07,060 --> 00:20:10,170
Who is for making Lev Davidovich Trotsky

207
00:20:10,190 --> 00:20:13,030
member of the Petrograd Soviet?

208
00:20:42,010 --> 00:20:43,190
Thank you.

209
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:50,090
Thank you.

210
00:20:50,210 --> 00:20:53,230
-I can not even look, as you shake hands with Lenin.

211
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,080
- In politics, Natasha, do not make sharp movements.

212
00:20:57,100 --> 00:21:00,110
Lenin is the head of the Bolsheviks. To get his people,

213
00:21:00,130 --> 00:21:03,200
I should not quarrel with him. -And then you are not a Bolshevik yourself?

214
00:21:03,220 --> 00:21:07,180
-Rano, Bolivars can not stand two. -What?

215
00:21:09,180 --> 00:21:11,090
1: Bring it on!

216
00:21:11,170 --> 00:21:15,190
First I discredit Lenin, then I'll take his place

217
00:21:15,210 --> 00:21:19,090
at the helm of the party. -It is interesting for you, for politicians.

218
00:21:19,110 --> 00:21:24,060
Everything is like in dogs: at first the asses are sniffed at each other, and then the throats are torn.

219
00:21:27,210 --> 00:21:31,040
And what did not you share with Lenin? He's like a normal guy.

220
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,190
-Peace. The whole world.

221
00:22:06,030 --> 00:22:09,220
-You are in charge of one of the last battle-worthy units of the Russian army,

222
00:22:09,240 --> 00:22:13,060
Mr. Kornilov. In times of general panic and retreat

223
00:22:13,080 --> 00:22:17,050
you manage not only to keep your front line, but also to take prisoners

224
00:22:17,070 --> 00:22:20,110
Austro-Hungarians. -Good to serve the Fatherland.

225
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,150
"I want to make you a Minister of War." Ask for so many parts,

226
00:22:25,170 --> 00:22:29,200
as you see fit. The main thing is to stop this fucking Germanic

227
00:22:29,220 --> 00:22:34,120
offensive. -You are a bully, Mr. liberal.

228
00:22:34,140 --> 00:22:38,190
But who has allowed this situation? I'll tell you: it's you,

229
00:22:38,210 --> 00:22:41,200
cabinet clean, not wishing to dirty gloves.

230
00:22:41,220 --> 00:22:45,150
-Don't bend the stick. I am a representative of civil authority,

231
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:52,000
but the problem is with you in the army. -Please, I'll show you yours.

232
00:22:52,020 --> 00:22:59,010
civil power. Kindly see: the agitator of the Bolsheviks,

233
00:22:59,030 --> 00:23:03,000
party that you in Petrograd not only tolerate, but also admit

234
00:23:03,020 --> 00:23:08,180
to printing machines. And here is what he gave to the soldiers. Admire.

235
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:17,010
"There is no German and Russian, there is a worker exploiter." Let's drop the rifles,

236
00:23:17,030 --> 00:23:22,020
we'll shoot at the officers, not each other. "

237
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,050
-But with this in my head, my people go into battle. And you from your fucking

238
00:23:26,070 --> 00:23:29,050
liberalism does not even try to prevent it.

239
00:23:29,070 --> 00:23:32,000
-I just do not want to plunge the country into bloody chaos.

240
00:23:32,020 --> 00:23:33,160
Fire

241
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:44,020
-The only way to avoid chaos now is to do just that.

242
00:23:48,020 --> 00:23:53,160
I am ready to accept your offer, but with the condition that

243
00:23:53,180 --> 00:23:58,040
in Petrograd, once and for all you will get rid of Bolshevik filth,

244
00:23:58,060 --> 00:24:02,120
which breaks up my army from the inside. -You're right. Bolsheviks can not

245
00:24:02,140 --> 00:24:06,120
to admit to power. I wait for the first legal reason and ...

246
00:24:06,140 --> 00:24:11,060
- Spit on legality. If this continues to appear among my soldiers,

247
00:24:11,080 --> 00:24:14,070
by my honor, I'll leave the front and advance to Petrograd,

248
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:17,210
to personally hang out on the pillars first of those who print this,

249
00:24:17,230 --> 00:24:21,190
and then those who can do this. I have the honor.

250
00:24:25,090 --> 00:24:29,000
- Join the Bolshevik Party! Only the Bolsheviks have a clear

251
00:24:29,020 --> 00:24:30,230
Event schedule

252
00:24:31,000 --> 00:24:33,100
"Well, are you really going to the Bolsheviks?"

253
00:24:34,010 --> 00:24:41,020
-You must pay tribute to Lenin, such a path from hatred to the love of the people.

254
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,130
Whom I see! -Dad mom! Imagine,

255
00:24:45,150 --> 00:24:49,090
Uncle Kolya drove us to the shooting gallery! -And I shot from targets on targets.

256
00:24:49,110 --> 00:24:52,010
-Well done. Give them money, let them buy something.

257
00:24:53,040 --> 00:24:54,230
Thank you

258
00:24:55,000 --> 00:24:58,220
-Greet Jews from the sailors of the Baltic! "Comrade Markin, I really appreciate all that,

259
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,160
what do you do for us, but if I ask you to pick up the children from the gymnasium,

260
00:25:02,180 --> 00:25:06,130
it means taking them out of the gymnasium, and not shooting them with a revolver.

261
00:25:06,150 --> 00:25:10,090
-You cho, hit the tail hit? Well gave your boys the powder to smell.

262
00:25:10,110 --> 00:25:13,120
And what? Who does not know how to handle weapons, is he a man?

263
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,220
-I can not handle. Am I not a man? It's just not included

264
00:25:16,240 --> 00:25:19,230
in the sphere of my vital interests. - Leva, do not get stuck.

265
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:23,160
-Don't worry so much. Well, you do not know how, I'll teach you. Lord, it's something.

266
00:25:23,180 --> 00:25:25,140
- Get your hands off that.

267
00:25:28,060 --> 00:25:30,220
Ok, I have to go. -I'm with you?

268
00:25:32,090 --> 00:25:37,150
-No, he's just impenetrable. Natalya spend with the guys to the house.

269
00:25:42,180 --> 00:25:44,170
-I did not say something, did I?

270
00:25:46,150 --> 00:25:48,180
-Do you go home?

271
00:25:50,020 --> 00:25:53,070
- Join the Bolshevik Party! Only the Bolsheviks have

272
00:25:53,090 --> 00:25:55,130
clear program!

273
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:03,210
-Where are you from, Kolya? -We are? From Penza.

274
00:26:04,170 --> 00:26:08,220
The village of Russian Syromyas. Not, but cho? From the river went - she, too

275
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:13,040
Syromyas is called. And there is also the Tatar Syromyas. Yes.

276
00:26:13,060 --> 00:26:17,130
So there in general: 1st Syromyasskaya, 2nd Syromyasskaya, 3rd Syromyasskaya.

277
00:26:17,150 --> 00:26:19,210
Do not get lost, in short. -Oh!

278
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:25,010
Wait, but Penza is far from the sea. How did you get into the fleet?

279
00:26:25,030 --> 00:26:27,240
-So who asked me? Called, and that's all. Well, me

280
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:30,040
like. I like the storm.

281
00:26:31,010 --> 00:26:35,220
Before that he worked in the food industry. Do not believe me, I got drunk off of boredom.

282
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:40,080
-Well, what do not you believe? I will.

283
00:26:43,080 --> 00:26:45,080
-Who is the last one, the bourgeois.

284
00:26:49,130 --> 00:26:53,000
Well, thank you for spending. -Let me straight to the front door.

285
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:56,090
-No no need. Next we ourselves. Thank you, Kolya.

286
00:27:29,070 --> 00:27:32,060
- Comrade Trotsky. -Yes.

287
00:27:35,010 --> 00:27:40,190
-I do not understand you. -What exactly do not you understand?

288
00:27:42,050 --> 00:27:48,050
- Specifically, we do not understand what you are doing in the revolution.

289
00:27:48,220 --> 00:27:53,200
We are building a just peace for the workers and peasants. And you?

290
00:27:53,220 --> 00:27:57,240
You're an intellectual. -Vladimir Ulyanov-Lenin

291
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:04,110
also an intellectual. What does it change? -No, you're confused, Trotsky.

292
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:09,070
Lenin is like an icon in a world without God.

293
00:28:10,150 --> 00:28:14,140
And which one of you is the icon? You're a Jew.

294
00:28:18,020 --> 00:28:21,060
-We will build a new world. For all.

295
00:28:21,230 --> 00:28:25,150
-No. We do not build for everyone.

296
00:29:05,140 --> 00:29:09,170
-Lev! And I wanted to go home, and then I think I'll wait for you.

297
00:29:09,190 --> 00:29:11,100
Here, I waited.

298
00:29:12,210 --> 00:29:19,110
You do not have to be angry with me, eh? If cho. My tongue is so bad.

299
00:29:19,130 --> 00:29:22,180
I always say first, and then I think that's where it's going.

300
00:29:22,200 --> 00:29:27,080
I'm a slow mind, after all. Leva, but to you with all my heart, do you hear?

301
00:29:27,100 --> 00:29:29,010
Well, it's true.

302
00:29:34,100 --> 00:29:36,040
Let's have a drink?

303
00:29:37,230 --> 00:29:43,130
You know, you can think whatever you want there, but you're all different to me.

304
00:29:47,060 --> 00:29:51,240
Though he is a Jew. And I'll tear your throats for you, so that, in honor,

305
00:29:52,010 --> 00:29:54,130
on conscience ... -Hair. I know.

306
00:29:54,150 --> 00:30:02,140
I, Nikolay, will need your help soon. Yours and your guys

307
00:30:02,160 --> 00:30:06,010
in Kronstadt. "It's not a question, Leva, my brother."

308
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:09,050
Than I can - I will help! Be.

309
00:30:34,140 --> 00:30:42,130
"Comrades, the Red Kronstadters, the bourgeois ministers are dragging Russia

310
00:30:42,150 --> 00:30:48,130
in the swamp of war, our comrades are arrested and sent to the Crosses.

311
00:30:48,230 --> 00:30:54,220
Meanwhile, the people's situation is no better than under the Bloody Nikolashka.

312
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,100
Correctly? CHOROM: That's right!

313
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,040
-How much will we endure it? - To hell with the ministers!

314
00:31:01,060 --> 00:31:06,230
-Give the power of the Bolsheviks! - Long live the red Kronstadt,

315
00:31:07,000 --> 00:31:11,160
glory and pride of the revolution! -Oh, brother, go to Peter!

316
00:31:11,180 --> 00:31:17,140
Let's show the bourgeois who is in charge! - Go and make yourself listen!

317
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:25,090
-Short to endure! Long live Lenin!

318
00:31:26,100 --> 00:31:29,070
Long live the Bolshevik Party!

319
00:31:29,240 --> 00:31:32,150
Let's free our brothers from prisons!

320
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,010
Aida, brothers!

321
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:10,090
-Shtyk, what has become of it?

322
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:13,230
"Alekseich, run away!"

323
00:32:18,030 --> 00:32:21,050
-Citizens are prisoners, will!

324
00:32:24,010 --> 00:32:26,190
-What do you mean, let all the prisoners go?

325
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:31,180
Find out who is behind this.

326
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:34,040
It is clear.

327
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,010
-You are a legitimate reason.

328
00:33:22,020 --> 00:33:25,100
Urgently write the order. For the attempt of the state

329
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,200
coup immediately arrest all the leaders of the Bolsheviks.

330
00:33:29,220 --> 00:33:33,090
And first of all - Lenin.

331
00:33:33,220 --> 00:33:38,040
-Last news! The rebellion of sailors is crushed by the Cossacks!

332
00:33:38,060 --> 00:33:40,220
All the leaders of the Bolsheviks fled the city!

333
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:45,130
Last news! All the leaders of the Bolsheviks fled the city!

334
00:33:55,070 --> 00:33:57,100
- So you did not go to bed?

335
00:33:58,230 --> 00:34:01,030
-Have you packed your suitcase? -Aha.

336
00:34:17,120 --> 00:34:19,060
Don't be scared . . .

337
00:34:22,150 --> 00:34:26,140
-How it became known to us, this vile provocation was planned

338
00:34:26,160 --> 00:34:31,130
the Bolshevik Party. Fortunately, we managed to stop this sneaky blow

339
00:34:31,150 --> 00:34:37,000
in the back. I issued a decree on the immediate arrest of all the leaders

340
00:34:37,020 --> 00:34:43,120
Bolsheviks. However, they fled cowardly, including their leader

341
00:34:43,140 --> 00:34:47,190
Ulyanov-Lenin. In this regard, I want to state the following ...

342
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:53,110
- I need your attention. As you know, I never concealed my

343
00:34:53,130 --> 00:34:57,050
sympathy for the ideas of the Bolshevik Party.

344
00:34:57,070 --> 00:35:02,150
And now, when its leaders threw hundreds of thousands of workers, soldiers,

345
00:35:02,170 --> 00:35:08,050
sailors who believed them, I can not stand aside and ask

346
00:35:08,070 --> 00:35:10,200
me a Bolshevik.

347
00:35:15,130 --> 00:35:18,000
-What should we do? -He leaves us no choice.

348
00:35:18,020 --> 00:35:21,190
-I publicly declare that I participated in the preparation of yesterday's

349
00:35:21,210 --> 00:35:26,080
events. I do not regret anything and do not intend to flee.

350
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:30,120
"In that case, Mr. Trotsky, you must be detained." Arrest him!

351
00:35:30,140 --> 00:35:35,090
-Peroda will be for us, because the truth is behind us.

352
00:35:35,110 --> 00:35:37,230
-Trotsky is the hero of the revolution! -Correctly.

353
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:40,190
SCANDE: Trotsky! Trotsky!

354
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:46,080
- Natasha, everything will be fine.

355
00:35:46,190 --> 00:35:48,130
I love you.

356
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,090
The phone rings.

357
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:06,240
"It's great that you dealt with the Bolsheviks, Mr. Kerensky.

358
00:36:07,010 --> 00:36:11,040
Let everyone leave, arresting only one? Yes, and he is alive and well.

359
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:15,000
-You can not imagine what will begin if he is shot.

360
00:36:15,030 --> 00:36:17,100
Besides ... - I do not care!

361
00:36:17,120 --> 00:36:21,240
If today he will not be shot by the evening, I am speaking in Petrograd.

362
00:36:22,010 --> 00:36:24,180
And I'll put you on the wall next to him.

363
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:46,040
-Well, Khan, you, zhdydara. I thought you were warming up here and after a month or two

364
00:36:46,060 --> 00:36:51,130
Kerensky will set you free? No. General Kornilov goes to the city.

365
00:36:51,150 --> 00:36:55,130
Here he is you, dogs, just will not be sorry. And you first on the lamp

366
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:57,130
the column will hang.

367
00:36:58,140 --> 00:37:00,070
Laughs.)

368
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:08,200
-Natasha ... I mean Natalia Ivanovna, no one expected this.

369
00:37:08,220 --> 00:37:12,160
- Can not you think of anything? -So, Natalia Ivanovna, understand,

370
00:37:12,180 --> 00:37:14,230
now the Cossack regiment is guarding the prison.

371
00:37:15,170 --> 00:37:19,120
"Kolya, I'm asking you, please, come up with something."

372
00:37:20,050 --> 00:37:22,160
Help me! For my sake, please!

373
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,210
-That's it! Basta.

374
00:37:56,130 --> 00:37:58,130
Do not go out of the house.

375
00:37:59,080 --> 00:38:02,150
If I do not come back, leave town.

376
00:38:02,170 --> 00:38:04,160
Today. All.

377
00:38:16,100 --> 00:38:18,010
Great, guys!

378
00:38:18,070 --> 00:38:20,010
What are serious?

379
00:38:20,100 --> 00:38:23,230
Severe. I have a question for the eldest. To the eldest. One question!

380
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,040
-This is the residence of the chairman of the Provisional Government.

381
00:38:27,060 --> 00:38:30,040
- Yes you that! I will not let you go without a special permit.

382
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:34,000
-A, special pass, right? I had it somewhere. Now.

383
00:38:34,090 --> 00:38:37,140
But where? Oh, by the way, noble boots!

384
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:43,080
Well then you! Well, neater!

385
00:38:46,150 --> 00:38:47,190
{450}{}{Stop!

386
00:38:48,040 --> 00:38:50,190
-Muzhiki, what are you? A?

387
00:38:50,210 --> 00:38:53,040
Are you guys? -What's going on here?

388
00:38:53,060 --> 00:38:56,040
-Yes, I tried to break through. - So arrest him.

389
00:38:56,060 --> 00:38:59,010
-It is possible and so, only I need to tell you the news

390
00:38:59,030 --> 00:39:00,190
from General Kornilov.

391
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:06,110
-Skip.

392
00:39:11,210 --> 00:39:15,040
"My mind is not very quick, Comrade Kerensky."

393
00:39:15,060 --> 00:39:17,010
-Take off.

394
00:39:17,210 --> 00:39:21,090
-That's the matter of your seams, and I understand. Yes, you yourself know.

395
00:39:22,040 --> 00:39:25,170
There's a gray face. You probably do not sleep well at night, do you?

396
00:39:25,190 --> 00:39:28,150
"Let's get to the point." -Yes, where is closer?

397
00:39:28,180 --> 00:39:32,070
Kornilov will not be in the city today or tomorrow. First the Bolsheviks

398
00:39:32,090 --> 00:39:33,170
will pull up, and then you.

399
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:37,120
Let Trotsky go - and I will help you save your skin.

400
00:39:40,050 --> 00:39:45,190
-And you know that your Trotsky demands not only to let him go,

401
00:39:45,210 --> 00:39:49,210
but also to arm the workers? -Of course! And who against Kornilov

402
00:39:49,230 --> 00:39:53,020
will go? Army? Yes, not in life!

403
00:39:53,050 --> 00:39:56,240
Everything is simple, Comrade Kerensky. To unite the workers against Kornilov

404
00:39:57,010 --> 00:40:00,080
can only Bolsheviks. And now in the city from the Bolsheviks

405
00:40:00,100 --> 00:40:01,220
only Trotsky.

406
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:24,190
-Oh well. Which you can give guarantees that if I give

407
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:29,030
your workers a weapon, they will not turn it against the government?

408
00:40:29,150 --> 00:40:30,240
-No.

409
00:40:56,140 --> 00:40:58,230
CROWD LIKE

410
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:17,120
-... manager was in the shop. A man - well ... a clean bear.

411
00:41:18,070 --> 00:41:24,110
Excuse me. As a pack zasunet ... In the sense of a person hit - immediately

412
00:41:24,130 --> 00:41:29,130
birds of paradise in the eyes. So, in the war, his hand was torn off.

413
00:41:29,150 --> 00:41:33,050
German mine, to the very elbow. -God, what horror!

414
00:41:33,070 --> 00:41:36,240
-Oh nothing. He came back and made himself a new one! Yes, wooden.

415
00:41:37,110 --> 00:41:40,180
They say that he learned to grumble ... in the sense of hammering this hand

416
00:41:40,200 --> 00:41:44,180
no worse than this. And since he was nothing like a peasant, his ...

417
00:41:52,120 --> 00:41:53,190
- Leo!

418
00:41:56,070 --> 00:41:58,210
- So they still had sex?

419
00:41:59,100 --> 00:42:05,090
- I do not care. I am for freedom for all and in everything.

420
00:42:08,200 --> 00:42:11,010
And it's not just words, Jackson.

421
00:42:16,150 --> 00:42:20,080
And then Kornilov never reached Petrograd.

422
00:42:21,020 --> 00:42:25,080
Thanks to Kerensky's cowardice and the mediation of Markin

423
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:29,220
was at the head of the working army in five thousand bayonets.

424
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:19,010
- Is this Frida?

425
00:43:19,080 --> 00:43:22,200
-This is a revolution ... and they are.

426
00:43:25,220 --> 00:43:27,170
And they part.

427
00:43:30,090 --> 00:43:33,070
They leave, but they continue to love each other.

428
00:43:34,180 --> 00:43:38,180
-Leva, I need to talk to you. -How interesting.

429
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,060
-I want you to take my words seriously.

430
00:43:46,080 --> 00:43:48,240
-I'm very serious. -Lev ...

431
00:43:50,180 --> 00:43:53,170
Trotsky as a legend is immortal, but not you.

432
00:43:54,090 --> 00:43:58,000
I have money, I can make you new documents and take you away

433
00:43:58,020 --> 00:44:00,210
A place where no one will ever find you.

434
00:44:00,230 --> 00:44:06,010
Your Natalya we can take with us. -Why all share me

435
00:44:06,030 --> 00:44:08,080
and the legend of Trotsky?

436
00:44:08,210 --> 00:44:10,240
There is no one without the other. No.

437
00:44:12,150 --> 00:44:16,060
Running with you, I will first of all betray myself,

438
00:44:16,080 --> 00:44:20,040
but not some fairy-tale character.

439
00:44:20,180 --> 00:44:23,220
-But you yourself said that betrayal is prejudice.

440
00:44:23,240 --> 00:44:26,070
-No, I did not say that.

441
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:32,120
I said that in the world I always dreamed of, there will be no place

442
00:44:32,140 --> 00:44:36,160
betrayal. But we live in this world.

443
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:47,090
-There, ahead, White's heels are already shining. And right along the shore -

444
00:44:47,110 --> 00:44:50,170
barn. Long, fathoms a hundred.

445
00:44:50,190 --> 00:44:55,170
My eagles stretched out and past the barn, let's run two by two.

446
00:44:55,190 --> 00:44:57,080
Comrades!

447
00:44:59,180 --> 00:45:03,120
So I say: we run past this barn, and there ...

448
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:09,240
"Why are you silent, Comrade Fedotov?"

449
00:45:11,020 --> 00:45:12,180
Go on.

450
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:15,080
-So I say ...

451
00:45:15,100 --> 00:45:19,020
Runs, we mean, and there ... -And there? ..

452
00:45:19,040 --> 00:45:22,140
Four machine-gun calculations of the enemy.

453
00:45:23,070 --> 00:45:25,230
So ... Comrade Rakinsky?

454
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:30,110
-So, Mrs. ...

455
00:45:31,230 --> 00:45:35,040
... a friend of the pre-war council.

456
00:45:35,190 --> 00:45:41,200
-The whites left four machine guns in the barn. Your platoon, Fedotov,

457
00:45:41,220 --> 00:45:45,000
they had to mow like grass.

458
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:51,180
-Let me notice, Lev Davidovich, the machine-gunners of the enemy from performing

459
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,020
The combat mission was abandoned, they did not shoot.

460
00:45:56,040 --> 00:45:59,040
- And they came to you with their hands up.

461
00:46:00,040 --> 00:46:03,160
-Yes sir. Having expressed the intention to move to the side ...

462
00:46:03,180 --> 00:46:07,220
"But they came to you, not to Fedotov?"

463
00:46:13,020 --> 00:46:15,130
I asked a question.

464
00:46:15,150 --> 00:46:18,200
-So, of course! Come to me.

465
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:26,190
-He was a royal officer, a military specialist, in whose devotion

466
00:46:26,210 --> 00:46:32,130
you all doubted, inspects the barn, does everything that is required

467
00:46:32,150 --> 00:46:38,220
were done by you, Fedotov. Your dashing stupidity, arrogance,

468
00:46:38,240 --> 00:46:46,000
negligence could cost the lives of all your soldiers.

469
00:46:47,100 --> 00:46:48,130
THE DOOR OPENED

470
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:51,160
-So! Opa! In the give, devils!

471
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:56,000
How cannons kokoshit enemy - so Markin, and as a victory to celebrate -

472
00:46:56,020 --> 00:46:58,060
so without Markin? Hold it!

473
00:46:58,170 --> 00:47:04,160
Oh, Lyova-Lyova, you're my head, golden, curly!

474
00:47:04,180 --> 00:47:07,000
The plan is what he came up with!

475
00:47:07,020 --> 00:47:09,040
Cannon the guns!

476
00:47:10,010 --> 00:47:12,090
I, muzhiks, when I saw him for the first time ...

477
00:47:12,110 --> 00:47:13,220
- Comrades!

478
00:47:16,160 --> 00:47:18,210
Offering a drink.

479
00:47:18,230 --> 00:47:25,190
Let's drink to the heroes who did not live up to that time.

480
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:40,100
-Oh, head, Lyova! Oh, my head!

481
00:47:40,120 --> 00:47:43,020
Lyova! Where are you going?

482
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:10,060
- An urgent dispatch. "Moscow, to Lenin.

483
00:48:10,170 --> 00:48:13,020
Intends to develop success,

484
00:48:13,210 --> 00:48:17,210
attack the garrison near Drunken Bora,

485
00:48:17,230 --> 00:48:25,030
by preliminary liquidating coastal artillery by a sabotage group

486
00:48:25,050 --> 00:48:30,010
under the command of ... Markina. Trotsky. "

487
00:48:30,120 --> 00:48:32,140
Send immediately.

488
00:48:33,220 --> 00:48:40,000
-The comrade of the pre-war council, the line is unreliable, my ciphers are old.

489
00:48:40,020 --> 00:48:44,040
If the telegram is intercepted, then for Markin this is a sure death.

490
00:48:48,210 --> 00:48:50,060
-Sent me.

491
00:49:08,100 --> 00:49:10,070
What do you want?

492
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:11,200
Why did you come?

493
00:49:11,220 --> 00:49:14,210
-What are you doing to me, brother? I did not have anything

494
00:49:14,230 --> 00:49:17,090
with Natalia. And could not be.

495
00:49:18,020 --> 00:49:20,090
-Why what does Natalya have to do with it?

496
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:23,060
I never went down to jealousy.

497
00:49:23,080 --> 00:49:25,190
-So why? -Why?

498
00:49:30,170 --> 00:49:36,160
We met at the time of my humiliation, the most powerful in life.

499
00:49:36,180 --> 00:49:42,160
You saw me pathetic and remembered this: a frightened intellectual

500
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:47,050
with trembling knees, which must be protected, guarded,

501
00:49:47,070 --> 00:49:54,090
which you can slap on the shoulder. And I was the chairman

502
00:49:54,110 --> 00:50:00,140
Revolutionary Military Council! A sacred deity!

503
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:03,190
A demon that everyone was afraid of, except for you.

504
00:50:04,050 --> 00:50:07,080
-What's the difference? I was your friend.

505
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:09,020
-No.

506
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:14,000
You made me human, but it was impossible, you can not.

507
00:50:15,100 --> 00:50:22,010
Humanity never wins in wars, only loses.

508
00:50:31,120 --> 00:50:34,070
- Be healthy, brotherly.
