CHRONICLE CHRONICLE SPEAKS IN ENGLISH

4
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:30,230
"Oh, Frank, my English is terrible." I have to unwind all the time

5
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,160
film at the beginning to catch the nuances of the commentary.

6
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:40,030
Do you believe in American journalism?

7
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:45,030
-No. But I need to know under what sauce Westerners cheat

8
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,020
philistine.

9
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:53,020
-Can you just be jealous? Imagine yourself there, in the square,

10
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:56,030
at the head of the parade. - Do not feel sorry for me.

11
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:01,130
I did not lose. -Triumfatorom you just do not look.

12
00:01:01,150 --> 00:01:06,040
In captivity of this house, under supervision. Where are your victories, Trotsky?

13
00:01:14,150 --> 00:01:16,040
Here it is:

14
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,100
... my victories.

15
00:01:30,080 --> 00:01:33,140
And you, do you think Stalin is the winner?

16
00:01:33,160 --> 00:01:36,080
-Meally. He created an empire.

17
00:01:37,070 --> 00:01:42,050
-Nothing like this. He's a victim. Hostage of own fears.

18
00:01:42,070 --> 00:01:49,080
He lives in a world full of enemies. Often, however, fictional.

19
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,180
-You can think, you do not have enemies. -Anyway, I feel

20
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,190
much freer.

21
00:02:07,100 --> 00:02:09,140
-What's wrong with you? -Heck.

22
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,120
- Lev Davidovich.

23
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:15,180
Lev Davidovich.

24
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,130
-Eh! Turn off this your ...

25
00:02:32,030 --> 00:02:35,150
-You accuse Stalin of everything, but meanwhile it's you, and he did not return

26
00:02:35,170 --> 00:02:37,210
the death penalty. Yes, it was necessary.

27
00:02:37,230 --> 00:02:39,180
Who "you"?

28
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,040
-Revolution.

29
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
-Yes, I'll take this one. It is somehow more habitual. Although we fit

30
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:02,050
Do not choose weapons, but the pillars on which we are hung up.

31
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:08,080
We were intoxicated by success. But to take the capital is not the same as taking the whole country.

32
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:12,070
"Even if this is so, we must hold power at all costs."

33
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,150
Since it is in our hands.

34
00:03:14,170 --> 00:03:19,070
-The same thing Stalin offers to Lenin. They are considering

35
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:22,030
your replacement on Shchastny.

36
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,110
-Where did you get this information? -It does not matter. Your authority in the fleet

37
00:03:31,130 --> 00:03:36,100
weak, and a combination with Shchastny could strengthen power.

38
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:39,160
Naturally, leaving you behind the brackets.

39
00:03:41,090 --> 00:03:43,030
-Yakov Mikhailovich. -Yes?

40
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,140
-And why are you so frank with me?

41
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,000
-I will say so ...

42
00:03:56,140 --> 00:04:01,150
I am also concerned about the strengthening of Stalin. So I help his opponent.

43
00:04:06,110 --> 00:04:08,240
-We are not opponents.

44
00:04:10,180 --> 00:04:12,060
Yes, I...

45
00:04:13,180 --> 00:04:16,030
Then you have nothing to worry about.

46
00:04:25,140 --> 00:04:29,030
-Why are we waiting for him here? Was he unable to receive us in the office?

47
00:04:29,050 --> 00:04:33,080
- There is no cabinet in Shchastny. He is always on ships or inspects

48
00:04:33,100 --> 00:04:37,230
garrison. -No, just wants to show us,

49
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,120
that we are on its territory. - Here he comes.

50
00:04:47,030 --> 00:04:50,180
- Comrade Pre-Military Council, once again I ask to forgive. State of the fleet

51
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,090
requires my constant presence here.

52
00:04:53,110 --> 00:04:57,060
- I understand everything, Alexey Mikhailovich. The first hero of Russia is not necessary

53
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:02,050
make excuses. Newspapers call your ice hike heroic.

54
00:05:02,070 --> 00:05:06,010
"And your irony is inappropriate, Comrade Trotsky." Only thanks to a friend

55
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,140
The private Baltic Fleet is here now, not the Germans.

56
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,010
-Can we talk in private?

57
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:24,150
As you know, I arrived on matters of extreme importance. The Germans are coming

58
00:05:24,170 --> 00:05:29,020
to Petrograd. We do not have any possibility to retain them. Breaking the line

59
00:05:29,040 --> 00:05:33,190
front, they will occupy Kronstadt. In order to avoid the seizure of the Baltic

60
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:40,180
We decided to prepare the fleet for destruction. I understand the measure

61
00:05:40,200 --> 00:05:45,230
extraordinary, but there is no other way out. -Kronstadt they can not take. We will

62
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:49,220
to defend himself to the last sailor. -Of course of course. But you know,

63
00:05:49,240 --> 00:05:53,120
according to the Treaty of Brest we have no right ...

64
00:05:53,140 --> 00:05:56,180
-My people risked their lives, removing the fleet first from Revel

65
00:05:56,200 --> 00:06:00,030
in Helsingfors, and then here, in Kronstadt. And now you want,

66
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:03,030
so I ordered them to blow it up? -Exactly, exactly ...

67
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,190
The operation is secret, so please prepare

68
00:06:07,210 --> 00:06:10,230
a few reliable people. Of course, their work will

69
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,180
well paid ... -I will not participate in this!

70
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:21,060
- It's not about your desires, Shchastny. That's an order.

71
00:06:21,080 --> 00:06:23,240
-I refuse to obey him.

72
00:06:24,010 --> 00:06:29,170
-I want to remind you of the oath. -I did not swear an oath to you, but to the country.

73
00:06:29,190 --> 00:06:32,130
And the fleet was not saved so that you would destroy it.

74
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:45,010
-Agentura Dzerzhinsky reports on the conspiracy to liberate the Romanovs.

75
00:06:45,220 --> 00:06:50,190
-This is to be expected. Holding the king in the Urals, we create

76
00:06:50,210 --> 00:06:54,230
for them a flag, a figure around which you can unite.

77
00:06:55,220 --> 00:07:00,010
The situation with the king must be solved in one way or another.

78
00:07:00,030 --> 00:07:05,010
It can not be kept suspended. What are the opinions?

79
00:07:05,030 --> 00:07:11,130
-We will build an open process. With maximum lighting in the press.

80
00:07:11,150 --> 00:07:16,180
Let us unfold before the world a picture of the entire reign of Romanov:

81
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:22,150
two wars, pogroms, famine ... -And the Red Army is ready to carry out

82
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,130
safety of his movement? The railway is controlled by Czechs,

83
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:30,200
rebels after your attempt to disarm them.

84
00:07:30,220 --> 00:07:34,140
"Even if Comrade Trotsky organizes the transportation of the tsar,

85
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:41,100
what I do not doubt, what will be the possible results?

86
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,010
Those who support us know perfectly well about the crimes of the tsar,

87
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:52,200
but those who are against us - those of us can not be persuaded.

88
00:07:57,180 --> 00:08:02,110
-SERMUX, immediately call to Moscow Shchastnogo.

89
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:09,030
Why? .. For the reward. He's a hero, after all.

90
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:18,170
Skip

91
00:08:27,180 --> 00:08:31,030
You can not go on. -And why else?

92
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,120
-Wait here.

93
00:08:42,010 --> 00:08:43,230
Will you allow me? -Yes.

94
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:52,100
Hello, comrade Shchastny. Sit down.

95
00:08:57,030 --> 00:08:59,060
Sit down, take a seat.

96
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:10,230
-That means ... it's not a reward?

97
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,060
- You ignored my order.

98
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:23,140
Did you really think that I would leave it just like this?

99
00:09:24,120 --> 00:09:28,180
-Your orders are incompetent. It means that they are harmful.

100
00:09:28,200 --> 00:09:32,180
Are they harmful? For whom? -For Russia.

101
00:09:38,190 --> 00:09:45,000
-You are a military man and you should know that failure to comply with the order in the army -

102
00:09:45,020 --> 00:09:48,200
this is treason. Arrest him.

103
00:09:52,210 --> 00:09:56,060
Raskolnikov, did you hear what I said?

104
00:10:00,010 --> 00:10:04,200
-Aleksiy Mikhailovich ... give up your weapons.

105
00:10:17,130 --> 00:10:21,090
-You will not give anything. The court will justify me.

106
00:10:21,110 --> 00:10:23,220
- Well, you have nothing to fear.

107
00:10:24,170 --> 00:10:30,070
-And I'm not afraid. Do not forget, Trotsky, on whose bayonets holds

108
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:32,170
your power. - Take him.

109
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,060
-Saving Shchastny, you defied the fleet. Radical elements

110
00:11:00,080 --> 00:11:03,220
among the sailors want to overthrow the Bolshevik government

111
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,070
and establish the dictatorship of the Baltic Fleet, led by Shchastny.

112
00:11:07,090 --> 00:11:10,080
- So arrest them. - You have already arrested the Czechs -

113
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,020
it worked perfectly! -Arests only exacerbate irritation

114
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,140
in the Navy. -We are power. We should not

115
00:11:17,160 --> 00:11:21,020
to adjust. - Lev Davidovich, I think that I express

116
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:24,110
general opinion, saying that for our dusty work

117
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:29,170
you are very impressive today. -And we neglect in vain

118
00:11:29,190 --> 00:11:36,170
aesthetics of the revolution. Wearing cuffs, we remain strangers to the masses.

119
00:11:36,190 --> 00:11:41,000
-At finally they started talking about the main thing! "Now, Comrade Koba,

120
00:11:41,020 --> 00:11:45,010
the danger of a coup, and Shchastny sought this.

121
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:48,040
- Do you have any proof? -I have confidence.

122
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,040
This is more important, Comrade Sverdlov. Shchastny is a danger

123
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:56,180
for a revolution that is easier to prevent than to combat it

124
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,130
consequences. -And how do you fight?

125
00:11:59,150 --> 00:12:02,070
Every hour that Shchastny spends in prison,

126
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:06,070
works for him and against us. -As with the family of the Romanovs,

127
00:12:06,090 --> 00:12:11,150
which we only tease the enemy. I believe that it is necessary ...

128
00:12:11,170 --> 00:12:15,230
return the death penalty. I'm against the return of execution!

129
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:19,180
-Lev Davidovich, the abolition of the death penalty is the greatest achievement

130
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,140
revolution. -Yes. Who will have to sacrifice,

131
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,090
to save this revolution.

132
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:34,150
We are surrounded by enemies. Against us all: the Germans, the Czechs, the Entente, the Kappel,

133
00:12:34,170 --> 00:12:39,030
internal enemy. There is a war in which we will not win

134
00:12:39,050 --> 00:12:42,150
without such an instrument. -We will push people away.

135
00:12:42,170 --> 00:12:47,200
-On the contrary. I think they will approve of us. We will show the people that we are ready to stand

136
00:12:47,220 --> 00:12:50,170
for his interests until the end.

137
00:13:10,110 --> 00:13:13,180
-Yes, I think, a revolution can not do without such an instrument.

138
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,190
The question is, which class will he be directed against.

139
00:13:18,050 --> 00:13:25,090
Sit down. Sit down, sit down. The very idea that the possibility of the death penalty

140
00:13:25,110 --> 00:13:28,120
there are, many sober.

141
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,220
I am for".

142
00:13:56,140 --> 00:13:58,000
-But it was not.

143
00:14:02,170 --> 00:14:08,060
-You can not let him get out of this. He is the enemy.

144
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:11,090
It's a question of survival ...

145
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:16,120
ours and the revolution. -It will be justified.

146
00:14:16,140 --> 00:14:20,120
One of my testimonies is not enough. -I will support you.

147
00:14:22,040 --> 00:14:26,120
Do what I ask. The rest I will settle. Good?

148
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:36,210
And you know what? Do not be afraid of it.

149
00:14:41,110 --> 00:14:47,000
From conversations with the officers of the fleet, I learned that Comrade Shchastny spread

150
00:14:47,020 --> 00:14:52,190
panic rumors about my alleged intentions to destroy the fleet.

151
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:56,050
Disclosing this information, Comrade Shchastny pursued

152
00:14:56,070 --> 00:15:00,030
the only goal is the creation of a counter-revolutionary

153
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:05,130
conspiracy in the navy. -If this is a conspiracy, then where else?

154
00:15:05,150 --> 00:15:07,220
conspirators? - Comrade Shchastny ...

155
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,230
"In time, Comrade Shchastny, we'll bring everyone to the surface."

156
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:18,090
That's all I wanted to say. -Well, the defense has no more questions

157
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,170
to the witness. -That means, the court ...

158
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:26,180
-The charge is still a witness - the Commissioner of the Naval General Staff

159
00:15:26,200 --> 00:15:29,100
Comrade Raskolnikov wants to give evidence.

160
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,010
- Comrade judge, Raskolnikov is not declared as a witness,

161
00:15:33,030 --> 00:15:35,160
it is not in the materials of the investigation.

162
00:15:37,070 --> 00:15:42,170
-What is more important for us - the truth or procedure?

163
00:15:45,140 --> 00:15:48,160
It's too serious.

164
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:56,050
If a witness wants to testify, he must be heard.

165
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:04,160
-We are ready to listen to him.

166
00:16:07,030 --> 00:16:11,220
-Captain of the first rank Shchastny led among the leadership of the People's Commissariat

167
00:16:11,240 --> 00:16:16,040
counter-revolutionary agitation. He also invited me to join

168
00:16:16,060 --> 00:16:20,010
to conspiracy to overthrow the Soviet power and establish

169
00:16:20,030 --> 00:16:24,050
dictatorship of the Baltic Fleet, in fact his personal dictatorship.

170
00:16:24,070 --> 00:16:29,090
- He's lying! Do not believe him! Bastard! -Well, stop now!

171
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:32,000
-Selling creature! - Bring him out of the hall.

172
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:34,110
-Sit. -Busk! The creature is corrupt!

173
00:16:34,130 --> 00:16:37,210
He's lying! Do not believe him! He's lying!

174
00:16:44,110 --> 00:16:49,110
"Comrade Raskolnikov, perhaps you will remind us all,

175
00:16:49,130 --> 00:16:52,090
when did this all happen? -What exactly?

176
00:16:52,110 --> 00:16:56,200
-When Captain Shchastny invited you to participate

177
00:16:56,220 --> 00:17:01,080
in a conspiracy? I can not tell you the exact day.

178
00:17:01,100 --> 00:17:07,230
-How do you ... Well, at least, maybe, you will call us a month?

179
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:13,020
-It was April, it seems to me. -How is it? And why are you only

180
00:17:13,040 --> 00:17:17,170
now remember this? Why did not you tell your leadership then?

181
00:17:17,190 --> 00:17:22,240
Why did not they tell the investigation? -I fully and fully realize

182
00:17:23,010 --> 00:17:28,080
his own fault for this. - Tell me, where was the meeting scheduled?

183
00:17:28,100 --> 00:17:31,220
-I do not remember. In my opinion, it was in my office.

184
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:36,200
- Comrade Shchastny, maybe he called you some names of people who

185
00:17:36,220 --> 00:17:40,080
a little earlier joined the conspiracy? -No.

186
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:46,160
-No? So, there were only you and he at the meeting?

187
00:17:46,180 --> 00:17:50,010
-Yes. -Clear. Well, to a friend

188
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:54,190
Raskolnikov, I have no more questions. And call him a witness ...

189
00:17:54,210 --> 00:18:00,050
Well, sorry, the language does not turn. The prosecution never provided

190
00:18:00,070 --> 00:18:04,180
no convincing proof of so-called treason

191
00:18:04,200 --> 00:18:08,200
my client. On the contrary, everything you heard from the defense,

192
00:18:08,220 --> 00:18:13,230
characterizes the captain as a patriot and faithful servant of the Russian people.

193
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:16,050
I will end on this.

194
00:18:18,190 --> 00:18:21,120
-The court leaves for the meeting.

195
00:18:29,220 --> 00:18:33,010
"Comrade Trotsky, where are you going?" Comrade Trotsky!

196
00:18:33,030 --> 00:18:36,050
You have no right. -Sit to your place!

197
00:18:36,230 --> 00:18:40,080
Sit down. On his own. A place.

198
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:50,010
"Comrade Trotsky, you can not be here."

199
00:18:50,030 --> 00:18:53,220
-For exceptional state importance

200
00:18:53,240 --> 00:19:00,050
In this process, I must be sure that you will issue the correct verdict.

201
00:19:00,180 --> 00:19:05,090
-You do not have the right to dictate to us what to do. There are rules!

202
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:09,130
- To hell with your rule if they contradict common sense.

203
00:19:09,150 --> 00:19:13,240
You must all understand: there is an enemy sitting in the courtroom.

204
00:19:14,010 --> 00:19:16,010
- He's a hero!

205
00:19:21,220 --> 00:19:28,130
-Yes, but, making a heroic feat, he created his popularity,

206
00:19:28,150 --> 00:19:32,040
intending to use it against Soviet power.

207
00:19:32,060 --> 00:19:36,160
This counter-revolutionary game has failed, and the punishment must be

208
00:19:36,180 --> 00:19:39,010
as severe as possible.

209
00:19:40,010 --> 00:19:46,210
I will regard any attempt to mitigate the sentence of Shchastny

210
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,220
as treason. I beg.

211
00:19:53,070 --> 00:19:58,240
-The shooting will give the sailors a martyr. -No.

212
00:19:59,010 --> 00:20:04,180
He will give them God in my face. Believe me, I know the psychology of the masses.

213
00:20:05,150 --> 00:20:08,110
-They will raise a rebellion. - They will not be raised - they do not have a leader.

214
00:20:08,130 --> 00:20:13,130
They are unorganized. The main thing is to get ahead of them, to act first.

215
00:20:13,150 --> 00:20:16,220
-How? Maybe slap him right here?

216
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:19,200
-In the center of Moscow? They'll hear.

217
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:25,010
- They will not hear.

218
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:29,180
Agranov!

219
00:20:46,020 --> 00:20:47,220
- Stand here.

220
00:20:48,170 --> 00:20:50,120
Creek!

221
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,100
THE MOTOR SPEAKED

222
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:56,220
You can not see anything! Headlight on it!

223
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,100
-Do not work.

224
00:21:04,010 --> 00:21:05,210
Aim in the light.

225
00:21:14,130 --> 00:21:16,060
-Wait!

226
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:22,120
Aim!

227
00:21:39,210 --> 00:21:41,050
Pli!

228
00:22:11,110 --> 00:22:13,020
-Trogsky!

229
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:27,130
You executed a man whose little finger was not worth it.

230
00:22:28,190 --> 00:22:32,210
Killing you, I save Russia.

231
00:22:41,060 --> 00:22:42,220
-Dad...

232
00:22:43,220 --> 00:22:46,050
Dad, I forgot the pencils!

233
00:22:47,180 --> 00:22:50,160
-This. Hush. -Daddy, it hurts!

234
00:22:50,180 --> 00:22:52,110
-It does not hurt.

235
00:23:03,070 --> 00:23:05,030
Quiet. Quiet.

236
00:23:17,100 --> 00:23:19,030
All is well.

237
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,050
You're doing fine. Well done. Come on.

238
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:41,000
- By abolishing the ban on the death penalty for your own personal purposes, you have opened

239
00:23:41,020 --> 00:23:45,000
thus the Pandora's box. You could not not understand this. The next victim

240
00:23:45,020 --> 00:23:51,040
for this immediately became the Romanovs. -The tsar's family needed it

241
00:23:51,060 --> 00:23:56,050
not just to intimidate or deprive the enemy of hope. No!

242
00:23:56,070 --> 00:24:01,050
First of all - to shake up your own ranks, show them:

243
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:07,240
retreat is impossible, there is a complete victory ahead or complete ruin.

244
00:24:08,130 --> 00:24:11,180
-And you know that the son of Nicholas II, a small czarevitch,

245
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:16,000
did not die right away? He was finished off with a bayonet.

246
00:24:19,240 --> 00:24:24,190
-Not interested in ever. I confess I do not understand this interest.

247
00:24:24,210 --> 00:24:29,140
I consider him shameful, philistine. THE MOTOR SPEAKED

248
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:37,150
From the point of view of morality, history, the death of the Tsarevich is not more significant,

249
00:24:37,170 --> 00:24:43,160
than the fate of hundreds of thousands of children doomed by tsarism to perish.

250
00:24:45,050 --> 00:24:50,170
If you are so pitiful, remember them. Or their lives are less significant

251
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:55,080
in the eyes of the creator? We did not follow the bourgeois

252
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:59,170
principle of guilt. No! We were led by a historical necessity.

253
00:24:59,190 --> 00:25:02,230
Yes that's it! NOISE FOR THE WINDOW

254
00:25:04,110 --> 00:25:08,160
Do you have to do this now, when I work?

255
00:25:09,140 --> 00:25:13,240
-Okay, if you are talking about morality, what will you say about words

256
00:25:14,010 --> 00:25:19,190
Voroshilov, who called you (quote) "author and inspirer of the red

257
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:24,000
terror. Trotsky strengthened his personal power by mass executions

258
00:25:24,020 --> 00:25:26,060
deserved communists "?

259
00:25:27,230 --> 00:25:32,130
-Voroshilov ... I, too, remembered the master of doom.

260
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:36,080
-He quotes here lists of people whose death sentences

261
00:25:36,100 --> 00:25:39,240
is your signature. -Jackson, you can not change the world,

262
00:25:40,010 --> 00:25:44,200
nothing in it without changing. In terms of class struggle, my actions

263
00:25:44,220 --> 00:25:49,210
fully justified. I executed the enemies who wanted to return

264
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:55,080
people into slavery. And do not think that they did not shoot us.

265
00:26:13,010 --> 00:26:16,170
"Comrade prerevolutionary council ..." "Continue, Comrade Commander."

266
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,040
So, the enemy will try to regain this part of the front.

267
00:26:23,060 --> 00:26:27,180
Therefore, our main task is to strengthen the bridgehead as much as possible.

268
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,010
-No! It is necessary to develop the offensive.

269
00:26:32,030 --> 00:26:36,180
Throw all the forces into a breakthrough while the enemy is in a panic. Of course,

270
00:26:36,200 --> 00:26:41,160
loss of human material is inevitable, but in this section

271
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,070
front ...

272
00:26:46,020 --> 00:26:49,070
Comrade Tukhachevsky, where are you going?

273
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:55,120
- To your car. You want to take my place, Comrade Trotsky.

274
00:26:56,070 --> 00:26:57,170
So I'll take yours.

275
00:27:12,090 --> 00:27:14,240
"Comrades, can I have some tea?"

276
00:27:21,130 --> 00:27:23,160
Tell me, why are you with us?

277
00:27:25,190 --> 00:27:29,080
-I serve Russia. -It's clear. But all the same?

278
00:27:33,080 --> 00:27:37,090
-Below back I was captain, now I command the army.

279
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:43,240
-That's a question of ambition. Our views you do not share.

280
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,130
-And what is more important to you? My loyalty or the coincidence of views?

281
00:27:49,150 --> 00:27:54,020
We are both supporters of a strong army, we definitely share this view.

282
00:27:55,230 --> 00:28:01,050
You did the impossible - created the spirit of this army.

283
00:28:01,230 --> 00:28:07,040
Sacrificial, exalted. The soldiers accepted you, they believed in you.

284
00:28:07,060 --> 00:28:11,200
A month ago you were called only a visiting Jew,

285
00:28:11,220 --> 00:28:16,150
now the Red Army soldiers say: "The Jews are in the Kremlin, Trotsky - no, this is ours."

286
00:28:17,140 --> 00:28:22,160
-Your words flatter me, but the people's love is an unreliable currency.

287
00:28:23,170 --> 00:28:29,110
In the royal army, too, were favorites. -Among them there was no Napoleon.

288
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:36,070
"What are you standing there, Sermuk, like a statue?" Report.

289
00:28:36,220 --> 00:28:40,030
- Lev Davidovich, an attempt was made on Lenin.

290
00:28:40,050 --> 00:28:42,180
Eserka Fanny Kaplan shot a revolver.

291
00:28:56,080 --> 00:28:58,090
-We return to Moscow, immediately.

292
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:05,130
-The terrible is behind. Doctors are sure:

293
00:29:05,150 --> 00:29:09,110
Vladimir Ilyich will get out.

294
00:29:11,030 --> 00:29:16,090
But such a serious injury will not pass without a trace.

295
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:20,100
- Including for us. I think we should learn from this story.

296
00:29:21,010 --> 00:29:22,220
-What kind?

297
00:29:24,060 --> 00:29:29,140
-Vladimir Ilich is a supporter of tough measures. And, perhaps, we should

298
00:29:29,160 --> 00:29:32,210
Use his absence to mitigate the policy.

299
00:29:32,230 --> 00:29:36,080
"What exactly do you propose, Comrade Kamenev?"

300
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:40,050
- Stop the bloodshed, proclaim the policy of national

301
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:46,050
reconciliation, try to start a dialogue. -With whom? With the bourgeoisie? With the priests?

302
00:29:46,190 --> 00:29:50,220
We create a future, in which we take not all.

303
00:29:51,110 --> 00:29:56,120
Let them die 30, 50, 70%, the rest will go with us.

304
00:29:57,180 --> 00:30:00,180
In communism. -Yes, how can you not see?

305
00:30:02,190 --> 00:30:05,150
The enemy responds to our violence with the same violence.

306
00:30:05,170 --> 00:30:12,150
-Not that. We will respond more harshly. We will reach the limits on which

307
00:30:12,170 --> 00:30:19,100
he does not have the courage. Cruelty will be ... biblical.

308
00:30:20,010 --> 00:30:23,050
We will cancel the court, the law.

309
00:30:25,230 --> 00:30:29,210
We will shoot several significant groups hostile to us

310
00:30:29,230 --> 00:30:35,230
interlayers, we organize concentration camps, we will debug the machine of suppression

311
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:40,210
counter-revolution and will punish. Not only the perpetrators, but also those,

312
00:30:40,230 --> 00:30:47,050
who is potentially dangerous. The enemy must clearly know: for every drop of our

313
00:30:47,070 --> 00:30:53,230
blood we will shed their river. This is the birth of a new world,

314
00:30:54,000 --> 00:30:57,080
and childbirth without blood, dirt, shit does not happen.

315
00:30:57,100 --> 00:31:03,030
The question is about survival: we or they. Only by proving to the enemy,

316
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:08,190
that we will not stop where he stops, we can

317
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:10,230
break his will.

318
00:31:17,050 --> 00:31:20,070
-I agree with Comrade Trotsky.

319
00:31:21,170 --> 00:31:27,170
-I will acquaint you with your position of Lenin. -No. No time to wait.

320
00:31:27,190 --> 00:31:31,070
Act immediately. Where is Kaplan?

321
00:31:32,030 --> 00:31:33,190
- In the cell, of course.

322
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:38,040
-Call it now, so that the information is in tomorrow's

323
00:31:38,060 --> 00:31:40,000
newspapers. -Er still interrogated,

324
00:31:40,020 --> 00:31:41,170
she has not yet named all the names.

325
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:49,070
-We do not need them. We will not execute concrete guilty persons, but those,

326
00:31:49,090 --> 00:31:55,190
whom we do not take with us to the future. This is the highest form of class struggle.

327
00:32:10,190 --> 00:32:18,040
Soon, very soon the Soviet Union that I created will take half of the world.

328
00:32:19,110 --> 00:32:21,070
And then all.

329
00:32:22,190 --> 00:32:27,060
So how do you think I won or lost?

330
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,170
-All depends on whether you like the world you created.

331
00:32:33,080 --> 00:32:37,150
Did you get what you wanted? Or something else happened?

332
00:32:39,000 --> 00:32:46,140
- It's a living process, Frank. Yes, life always introduces inevitable adjustments.

333
00:32:47,060 --> 00:32:53,140
At least, I did everything to defeat the enemies ... of the revolution.

334
00:32:53,180 --> 00:32:57,060
- Which became all those who did not support the Bolsheviks.

335
00:32:57,080 --> 00:33:02,150
-Yes. Because the Bolsheviks were a revolution. Only they defended

336
00:33:02,170 --> 00:33:08,040
the interests of the working class: peasants, soldiers, sailors. Only they.

337
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,020
-And then with whom did you fight in Kronstadt? There was no

338
00:33:14,040 --> 00:33:19,200
noblemen and priests. The same sailors and workers who brought you

339
00:33:19,220 --> 00:33:21,080
to power.

340
00:33:26,240 --> 00:33:31,230
-3.5 years Bolshevik usurpers

341
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:36,200
hold power. 3,5 years prowl

342
00:33:36,220 --> 00:33:41,190
through the villages their outfits, peeling the peasants and dooming them to hunger

343
00:33:41,210 --> 00:33:49,020
death. For 3.5 years the Bolsheviks sacrifice their bloody gods:

344
00:33:49,040 --> 00:33:52,010
Lenin and Trotsky!

345
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:56,040
-You have created such a convincing myth about revolutionary sailors,

346
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:59,150
that they themselves believed it. -You sure that they will not be supported

347
00:33:59,170 --> 00:34:01,220
workers of Peter? - Who owns the newspaper -

348
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:05,180
owns minds, Comrade Tukhachevsky. You printed that the insurgency had raised

349
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,220
Tsarist General Kozlovsky, and the workers hate this audience pohlesche us.

350
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:13,220
-Working hate you? -Well, some part.

351
00:34:13,240 --> 00:34:17,070
Workers are heterogeneous, but this is the lesser of our problems.

352
00:34:17,210 --> 00:34:22,130
-We demand real democracy! SUPPORTING CROWNS OF THE CROWD

353
00:34:22,240 --> 00:34:26,240
We demand to give the road to non-Party people! CROWD: Yes!

354
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:32,200
-Return to the Soviets, crushed by the Iron Paw of the Communists,

355
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:35,170
their real power! CROWD: Yes!

356
00:34:35,190 --> 00:34:40,080
-To enable the peasant to work on the cultivated plot of land

357
00:34:40,100 --> 00:34:42,170
be the master! CROWD: Yes!

358
00:34:43,100 --> 00:34:46,210
- Tell me how you are going to suppress the mutiny.

359
00:34:46,230 --> 00:34:50,060
- I would prefer to give up this mission. If I may.

360
00:34:56,110 --> 00:34:59,050
-Why? - It's not the front.

361
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:06,020
It's one thing to fight with the enemy's army, quite another to punish one's own.

362
00:35:06,170 --> 00:35:09,120
Workers, sailors. -Since when

363
00:35:09,140 --> 00:35:12,210
they have become for you their own, Comrade Tukhachevsky?

364
00:35:13,210 --> 00:35:17,030
In any case, there is not much valor in it.

365
00:35:18,060 --> 00:35:24,000
- And let's look at it from the other side. It's a challenge, it's a test.

366
00:35:24,020 --> 00:35:28,200
your qualities as a commander. Good afternoon. Consider it

367
00:35:28,220 --> 00:35:30,230
as a tour. -Gastrol?

368
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,210
-Gastrol. You play the violin. Here you have just the first violin.

369
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:40,010
You are a talented professional and always perform the tasks set for you

370
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:44,190
tasks, so, I think, it will not be very difficult for you.

371
00:35:47,170 --> 00:35:54,030
"From here, from this place, we, the revolutionary sailors

372
00:35:54,050 --> 00:35:59,090
Kronstadt, we will begin what we should have done long ago.

373
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:05,170
Liberation of Russia! They abandoned Nicholas, comrades,

374
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:11,100
we will throw out also communists! Hooray! Hooray! Hooray!

375
00:36:22,190 --> 00:36:25,030
- Stop it. Stop it!

376
00:36:26,210 --> 00:36:29,200
What's that smell? -Solar. The corpses are burning.

377
00:36:53,130 --> 00:36:55,060
"Comrade Trotsky!"

378
00:36:57,220 --> 00:37:03,080
Do you remember me? Agranov Yakov. We shchastnogo slapped in the courtyard,

379
00:37:03,100 --> 00:37:04,180
Remember!

380
00:37:06,100 --> 00:37:07,240
I'm in the Cheka now.

381
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:16,040
Work we have no end!

382
00:37:17,120 --> 00:37:20,240
They have friends after all, friends, relatives - it's understandable,

383
00:37:21,010 --> 00:37:25,070
what public. We must deal with all this ruffian!

384
00:37:40,050 --> 00:37:44,180
-Lenin is completely bad. Nadia says, it is weakening fast, the consciousness loses

385
00:37:44,200 --> 00:37:50,020
at work. He was put in a couch in the study - he lies almost all the time.

386
00:37:50,040 --> 00:37:54,000
-And who manages? -Stalin.

387
00:37:55,170 --> 00:37:59,190
While you were gone, he became stronger. I gathered around me new people,

388
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:04,040
promoted them to leadership positions. It became the eastern vizier.

389
00:38:07,160 --> 00:38:10,120
- Hello, Comrade Trotsky. -Hello.

390
00:38:10,140 --> 00:38:14,180
-To Ilyich is not allowed now, doctors are allowed to work only in the morning.

391
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:21,160
-I do not for a long time. -We all adjust,

392
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:25,190
Comrade Trotsky. I'm afraid, and you will ...

393
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:32,180
- I'll be back tomorrow. - Tomorrow Ilyich in Gorki.

394
00:38:32,200 --> 00:38:38,080
Come to me at eight o'clock, we will discuss all the issues.

395
00:38:38,240 --> 00:38:45,020
I would have talked with you now, but, unfortunately, the affairs are notorious - the turnover.

396
00:38:45,110 --> 00:38:48,090
The war is over, you have done your work.

397
00:38:48,110 --> 00:38:50,020
Now it's our turn.

398
00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:16,200
ALARM MUSIC

399
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,020
-I had as a child ... in the courtyard ...

400
00:41:13,180 --> 00:41:15,240
still in Simbirsk ...

401
00:41:17,230 --> 00:41:20,060
lived a janitor.

402
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:32,120
So, he assumed that almost all the evil in the world from books.

403
00:41:35,120 --> 00:41:43,060
They were for him something like instructions from the other world.

404
00:41:45,150 --> 00:41:50,210
He seriously believed that books could be blinded. I laughed at him

405
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:57,080
then, and now I think: "Maybe he's right and we are blinded?"

406
00:42:00,110 --> 00:42:07,210
"I have always been aware of my own affairs, and I do not regret anything.

407
00:42:08,100 --> 00:42:10,000
"Yes.

408
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:16,110
And I'm very sorry that I did this to the king.

409
00:42:21,050 --> 00:42:22,210
He did not understand anything.

410
00:42:25,010 --> 00:42:26,150
Did not have time to realize.

411
00:42:29,070 --> 00:42:31,230
I did not feel the inevitability of death.

412
00:42:35,150 --> 00:42:42,090
He did not have to lie to the children, tell them that everything would be fine,

413
00:42:42,110 --> 00:42:45,230
as you had. You promised the children that everything will be fine.

414
00:42:47,110 --> 00:42:48,190
Yes . . .

415
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:55,210
The enemy must be kept waiting for death.

416
00:42:56,200 --> 00:43:02,240
Enjoying the fear that will devour him from the inside,

417
00:43:03,010 --> 00:43:07,150
as Stalin does. -I do not give a damn about him.

418
00:43:07,170 --> 00:43:13,160
This is not a prison, and I'm free. "Do not lie to yourself, Leo!"

419
00:43:15,110 --> 00:43:22,110
You run into a world of fantasy and ghosts, because in you

420
00:43:22,130 --> 00:43:28,130
Fear settled. Whatever you say to yourself, you know perfectly well,

421
00:43:28,150 --> 00:43:33,190
that you are alive only because the mustachioed allows you to live.

422
00:43:34,060 --> 00:43:37,210
- That's enough. -Every minute you look

423
00:43:37,230 --> 00:43:44,120
in the faces of people around you and ask yourself: "Who will betray

424
00:43:44,140 --> 00:43:48,180
you, who of them and when? "- Shut up!

425
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:54,140
-All your nature screams from the inside: "Hurry! Quick!" - because

426
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:02,070
no more urine to endure! -I'm not afraid of death.

427
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:09,010
-You are afraid ... All are afraid, and you are afraid. You are the same person as everyone else.

428
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:14,020
Not God, not a prophet - a man of flesh and blood. And you are afraid, because

429
00:44:14,040 --> 00:44:20,020
you do not know what's there on the other side.

430
00:44:22,030 --> 00:44:25,070
And what if I have to answer?

431
00:44:28,220 --> 00:44:30,180
What will you answer them?

432
00:44:38,180 --> 00:44:41,060
And you say, you are not afraid.

433
00:44:45,150 --> 00:44:46,200
GO

434
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:53,200
Go, go out into the street. Finish it all right now.

435
00:45:22,070 --> 00:45:30,040
-Well, let's. I'm not afraid of you. Do you hear? Where are you there?

436
00:45:49,050 --> 00:45:53,130
ON-SPANISH: Senor, are you all right? Senor, what's the matter with you?

437
00:45:57,030 --> 00:45:58,140
Senor ...

438
00:46:01,050 --> 00:46:04,080
Pablo, rather call an ambulance, the señora is bad.

439
00:46:04,210 --> 00:46:06,160
- Leo!

440
00:46:10,200 --> 00:46:12,220
Sylvia, call the doctor.
