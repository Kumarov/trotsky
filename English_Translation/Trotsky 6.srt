00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:49,180
STUCKING THE DOOR-Senor Jackson! Senhor Jackson!

4
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:00,210
You were asked to transfer.

5
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,010
Here you go.

6
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:26,110
SPEAKS IN SPANISH

7
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:39,130
Do you understand that there are places where a woman should not be? Even in the afternoon.

8
00:01:39,150 --> 00:01:44,060
Come, I'll take you to my room. -No. You are an excellent lover

9
00:01:44,080 --> 00:01:49,220
for everyone, but not for me. No one else can be

10
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:54,050
really good in bed after him. He had all this

11
00:01:54,070 --> 00:01:59,120
the fucking world. To sleep with him is like injecting a drug directly into the brain.

12
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:02,130
It's like sleeping with God himself, you know?

13
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:10,220
- Then let me take you home. -What for? I feel good here.

14
00:02:11,210 --> 00:02:15,070
Frank, you're very much alike with him. You do not love either

15
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:16,220
recognize defeat.

16
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:26,010
Pass it to him. And tell me ...

17
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:34,050
No, do not say anything. -I do not want to see him,

18
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,100
especially now. - Do it for me.

19
00:02:44,060 --> 00:02:48,100
-Good. He called me today for a picnic.

20
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,110
"Jackson, my friend, you are not yourself today." Do not blame me for everyone

21
00:03:22,130 --> 00:03:25,120
sins of men. Something happened?

22
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,090
-Nothing. -Ah.

23
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,050
-Today one person told me that I do not know how to admit defeats.

24
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,070
And that in this I look like you. -Aha! But I have nothing to admit.

25
00:03:44,140 --> 00:03:50,090
I never had real defeats, although I repeatedly

26
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:55,100
stood on the edge. But I always managed to change the situation

27
00:03:55,120 --> 00:04:00,010
in their favor. A clear example of this is the story on the armored train ...

28
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:03,220
"Listen, I do not care about your armored train, he's fed me!"

29
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:08,130
I understand that these are the best years of your life, the peak of power, but I would like

30
00:04:08,150 --> 00:04:12,020
to hear about something else. "Now I recognize you, Frank."

31
00:04:12,140 --> 00:04:15,220
Come on, come on. What are they accusing me of today?

32
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:21,110
-Brest world.

33
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,060
-This is ridiculous. People will not forgive you. Well, can not you not sign

34
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,130
this damned world?

35
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,180
-Nelzha. There is actually no army,

36
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,080
there is nobody to fight. We will not give the Germans what they want - they themselves are half the country

37
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:52,030
will conquer. -So, damn it,

38
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,240
make the soldier fight! -How do you not understand? ..

39
00:04:58,100 --> 00:05:03,000
We ourselves have disintegrated the army. Now these soldiers can not be forced

40
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:05,190
fight. - Get out. Well, they can not

41
00:05:05,210 --> 00:05:08,090
to force you. -Lenin only waits for that.

42
00:05:08,110 --> 00:05:12,020
"Comrade Trotsky refused the archival mission!

43
00:05:12,040 --> 00:05:14,120
Down with Comrade Trotsky! "No.

44
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:20,020
Well, everything, it's time.

45
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:42,000
PLAY "INTERNATIONAL"

46
00:05:59,020 --> 00:06:00,130
Do not you mind?

47
00:06:14,130 --> 00:06:18,070
-Because you are, you are the same Trotsky, the head of the current

48
00:06:18,090 --> 00:06:20,120
government foreign affairs.

49
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,160
I guess we should drink ... for an acquaintance.

50
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,040
You are disingenuous about the third way. From the impasse in which you,

51
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,150
Bolsheviks, drove Russia, there are only two ways out - surrender and death.

52
00:07:22,170 --> 00:07:27,090
-Vladimir Evstafievich, let's be frank. Is it not you, the royal

53
00:07:27,110 --> 00:07:32,150
generals, you have so deeply moved your beloved Russia into the war?

54
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:36,010
-We did our duty. If it were not for yours, if I may say so,

55
00:07:36,030 --> 00:07:39,180
revolutionary agitation ... Remember what you called the soldiers.

56
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:43,020
"Shoot the officers, fraternize with the enemy soldier!"

57
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:46,020
-Who is to blame, that our ideas were closer to the soldier?

58
00:07:46,040 --> 00:07:49,160
-Your ideas turned the battle-worthy Russian army into a herd of cattle!

59
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:53,080
And you did it, Bolsheviks! -I'm going to remind you that, despite

60
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,030
on this, you still deign to accept the power of the Bolsheviks,

61
00:07:57,050 --> 00:07:59,200
Comrade Skalon. So dull your ardor.

62
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,070
-I did not take your power, I accepted the will of Russia.

63
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:08,090
My motherland, she ...

64
00:08:10,030 --> 00:08:16,180
as a beloved, but a mad woman - does not understand what she is doing.

65
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:22,220
But then he will understand, be horrified and regret.

66
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,060
But I will always be with her. And in joy and in sorrow.

67
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:34,230
-Bravo! Words of a true patriot. "Russia", "motherland" - all this

68
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:41,100
empty sound. Yesterday Courland was Russia, tomorrow it will be

69
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:46,010
Germany. Tell me that the Kurland is considered your fatherland, eh?

70
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:50,170
The world revolution will abolish the very concept of homeland. It is obsolete,

71
00:08:50,190 --> 00:08:55,230
as well as everything, than you lived. No more your Russia, forget it.

72
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:05,010
-And what prevents me from shooting you right here and now?

73
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:07,180
At least I'll keep the officer's honor.

74
00:09:10,060 --> 00:09:11,200
-Businessman?

75
00:09:14,190 --> 00:09:16,140
-Children, comrades? ..

76
00:09:19,180 --> 00:09:21,130
- Put it on the table.

77
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,060
-German government insists on the immediate signing of a peaceful

78
00:10:14,080 --> 00:10:21,000
Treaty on the basis of self-determination of the peoples of Poland, Lithuania, Courland,

79
00:10:21,020 --> 00:10:26,160
Estland and Livonia. As certificates of will

80
00:10:26,180 --> 00:10:34,020
of these peoples, the German government considers applications

81
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:42,040
the governments of Poland, Lithuania, Courland, Estland and Livland,

82
00:10:42,060 --> 00:10:46,210
signed in November and December this year.

83
00:10:46,230 --> 00:10:49,200
-Lithland also departs the German Empire?

84
00:10:49,220 --> 00:10:53,160
-People of Poland expresses their desire to join Germany? Rave!

85
00:10:53,180 --> 00:10:57,100
-Pretty! What kind of circus did you want us to show here? This is not the will

86
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:00,240
peoples. These pisulki at the price of a penny recorded under your dictation

87
00:11:01,010 --> 00:11:03,220
puppet rulers of the occupied parts

88
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,000
Russian Empire! -Herr Scalon, you, as the former

89
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:10,200
the tsarist general, forgive forgetting: the Russian Empire

90
00:11:10,220 --> 00:11:16,130
There are no more, but there are these ... Councils of Jewish deputies.

91
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:38,180
-How the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, I responsibly declare:

92
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:45,180
Soviet Russia is ready to sign an agreement. However, I would like

93
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,060
give a clearer status of Livonia.

94
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:55,020
-If this is the only problem, by the end of the week we will prepare

95
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:56,170
all the papers.

96
00:11:59,230 --> 00:12:02,220
Nice to meet you, Mr. Trotsky.

97
00:12:06,020 --> 00:12:10,160
-Praise me in the shortest possible time to arrange the production of propaganda leaflets

98
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:15,050
in German. Write about strikes and police officers

99
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:21,200
arbitrariness. The revolution in Germany is a matter of time. Our task -

100
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:26,200
accelerate this time. In articles it is necessary to give an exhaustive

101
00:12:26,220 --> 00:12:31,120
a picture of the state of affairs in Germany, which the German authorities, as they can,

102
00:12:31,140 --> 00:12:37,200
they hide from their soldiers. Dot. I order the distribution of leaflets

103
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:41,230
half a million copies on all fronts, where the Russian soldiers

104
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:47,200
come into contact with the German ones. Dot. People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Trotsky.

105
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:56,150
- Do you think his plan will work? -Maybe.

106
00:12:56,220 --> 00:13:03,150
- And will you let him do this? After all, in this case, he will become the savior of Russia.

107
00:13:04,060 --> 00:13:11,080
-Koba, it seems to me that the fate of Comrade Trotsky has been worrying you of late

108
00:13:11,100 --> 00:13:13,200
more than the fate of the revolution itself.

109
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,170
- Bessonnay night, Mr. Hoffmann?

110
00:14:07,150 --> 00:14:13,000
Well, it's time to discuss your separate peace with Ukraine.

111
00:14:13,160 --> 00:14:19,230
-What Ukraine? What does Ukraine have to do with it? -Well, how.

112
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:29,030
You have concluded a separate peace with part of Russia. Under it subscribed

113
00:14:29,050 --> 00:14:31,140
illegitimate government.

114
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:36,230
-Do you fool me?

115
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:44,180
- We will continue, when Mr. Hoffman will clean his shoes and remember the rules

116
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,200
diplomatic etiquette.

117
00:15:02,180 --> 00:15:07,170
-The Soviets defiantly delay the time. This can no longer be tolerated.

118
00:15:08,090 --> 00:15:11,060
I propose today to advance to Grodno and ...

119
00:15:11,080 --> 00:15:15,180
"Are you an idiot, Hoffmann?" What war? What is Grodno? In our country

120
00:15:15,200 --> 00:15:18,130
revolution! Do you at least understand this?

121
00:15:29,080 --> 00:15:31,140
-What did you decide, my Kaiser?

122
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,240
The account goes to the clock.

123
00:15:38,200 --> 00:15:42,180
-Rose on the rebels the army and allow to shoot at the defeat.

124
00:16:03,210 --> 00:16:11,000
-When I go to the signing of the contract, I happily report:

125
00:16:11,020 --> 00:16:16,080
The attempt of the revolution in Germany failed. General strike

126
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:22,030
terminated. The military factories are working again. By direct instruction

127
00:16:22,050 --> 00:16:27,020
Emperor Wilhelm II we are in the ultimate form

128
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:33,070
We demand that Russia sign a peace agreement within 24 hours.

129
00:16:33,090 --> 00:16:39,060
In paragraph five, the following changes were made. Russia undertakes

130
00:16:39,080 --> 00:16:44,230
immediately complete demobilization of his army,

131
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:50,040
including the military units that were created by her current

132
00:16:50,060 --> 00:16:56,030
government. In addition, Russia should withdraw its military vessels

133
00:16:56,050 --> 00:17:01,070
into Russian ports and leave them there before the signing of universal peace

134
00:17:01,090 --> 00:17:07,030
or completely disarm them. Military vessels of states,

135
00:17:07,050 --> 00:17:12,220
who continue to be at war with the countries of the Quadruple Union,

136
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:17,230
since they are in the sphere of Russian power, they are equated to Russian

137
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:19,080
military courts.

138
00:17:20,040 --> 00:17:23,190
-What do you mean "do not sign"? Is it still war or peace?

139
00:17:23,210 --> 00:17:26,140
-This is the third way - not peace and not war. Record it.

140
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,130
Urgent order of the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Trotsky. Immediately remove all

141
00:17:30,150 --> 00:17:32,220
troops from positions. -Yes, he's crazy, gentlemen!

142
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:37,000
-If the war was ever waged in self-defense, it had long since ceased to exist

143
00:17:37,020 --> 00:17:40,140
be one for both sides. -I told you, he's crazy!

144
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:45,080
You trusted the madman, gentlemen! He's gone crazy! Stop it!

145
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:48,020
-Hopeful! - He's a traitor! Arms!

146
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:52,190
This is madness.

147
00:17:54,220 --> 00:17:59,030
"Are you definitely going to go, gentlemen?" -Performed.

148
00:18:00,030 --> 00:18:03,200
-I spoke to the Germans. They guarantee safe haven for all those who are not connected

149
00:18:03,220 --> 00:18:06,240
with the Bolsheviks. -I can not with the Germans.

150
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:11,090
I do not understand how you decided to do this, Vasily Mikhailovich.

151
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:16,180
-Vladimir Evstafievich ... General Skalon, are you all right?

152
00:18:18,220 --> 00:18:20,220
-Do not worry, gentlemen.

153
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:27,000
-Skalon, are you going? -I am now, Alexander Alexandrovich.

154
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:19,240
-I can not help noticing that this poor fellow had every reason to hate you.

155
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:23,100
You lied about the fact that Russia did not have the resources to continue

156
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:26,200
war. They were, just were in opposition to the Soviets.

157
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:29,070
-And who is it? -The same Cossacks.

158
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:33,230
-Well, of course. Where without them? -Take it, Lev Davidovich. You had

159
00:19:34,000 --> 00:19:37,210
the opportunity to discourage strife and rally with the internal enemy

160
00:19:37,230 --> 00:19:41,110
in the face of an external enemy. Especially Germany was already exhausted

161
00:19:41,130 --> 00:19:44,240
and was on the brink of defeat. -Conclude a similar union,

162
00:19:45,010 --> 00:19:49,200
this would mean that the new world we are building is not capable of

163
00:19:49,220 --> 00:19:53,200
exist without the traditional pillars of the old world.

164
00:19:53,220 --> 00:19:57,150
-However it would be possible to preserve a great state, and hate you

165
00:19:57,170 --> 00:20:01,080
Stalin would not have had to struggle so hard to get Finland back,

166
00:20:01,100 --> 00:20:05,090
The Baltic States and Galicia. You preferred to bend under the German, and your pride

167
00:20:05,110 --> 00:20:06,170
cost ... -Thy.

168
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:12,070
-What? -T-sh-sh.

169
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:21,130
Do you know how the natives call this place?

170
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:28,050
Alla del Cododrilo - Crocodile whirlpool.

171
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:31,120
Here.

172
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:38,030
Jackson, do not move. Do not move!

173
00:20:38,050 --> 00:20:42,180
Jackson, you attract the attention of predators. Do not move.

174
00:20:43,180 --> 00:20:47,100
-You're crazy! -I am German. Imagine that I'm German.

175
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:51,040
Well, what will you do? Wait, when they eat you here?

176
00:20:51,060 --> 00:20:54,200
Or use the outstretched hand of help? A?

177
00:20:59,170 --> 00:21:05,000
You would now see your eyes full of hatred and horror

178
00:21:05,020 --> 00:21:09,160
Simultaneously. I deceived you, there are no crocodiles. Get out.

179
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:21,120
I want you to understand one simple thing. I was knocked down many times

180
00:21:21,140 --> 00:21:25,050
and threw them into the pool. It does not matter. It is important that every time I get up

181
00:21:25,070 --> 00:21:29,060
and swam out. And the Brest peace as a result was forced to

182
00:21:29,080 --> 00:21:32,020
to sign Lenin. Like this.

183
00:22:23,010 --> 00:22:26,010
I will call things by their proper names.

184
00:22:26,030 --> 00:22:30,020
Negotiations with Germany failed, in connection with which I officially

185
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:33,160
I resign from myself the People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs.

186
00:22:33,180 --> 00:22:36,050
"Simply put, it's called" washing your hands. "

187
00:22:36,070 --> 00:22:40,110
"I'm not going to wash my hands, Vladimir Ilyich. From what happened

188
00:22:40,130 --> 00:22:43,190
we all must learn a lesson.

189
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:50,020
The country can no longer exist without a strong, disciplined,

190
00:22:50,040 --> 00:22:54,010
ready for military operations. "Do not leave the topic, Comrade Trotsky."

191
00:22:54,030 --> 00:22:57,050
-I am not going to absolve myself of the responsibility for failure

192
00:22:57,070 --> 00:23:01,120
negotiations, but if we had a capable army, no one

193
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:06,210
I would not dare to dictate to us any conditions. Proceeding from the aforesaid,

194
00:23:06,230 --> 00:23:12,000
I ask you to entrust me with the duty of the Commander-in-Chief

195
00:23:12,020 --> 00:23:15,190
and the task of creating a new Red Army.

196
00:23:15,210 --> 00:23:18,240
-You could not cope with the signing of a peace treaty

197
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:22,210
and want to cope with the war? -If someone from the audience wants to

198
00:23:22,230 --> 00:23:27,070
take responsibility for the restoration of the army, I ask.

199
00:23:35,090 --> 00:23:37,180
-In the meeting, a break is announced.

200
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:58,230
I hope you are aware, Lev Davidovich, that if you

201
00:23:59,000 --> 00:24:02,170
fail also this time ... -I understand perfectly, in this connection

202
00:24:02,190 --> 00:24:05,010
I have one condition.

203
00:24:05,170 --> 00:24:07,110
-Condition? -Yes.

204
00:24:10,100 --> 00:24:14,130
The key posts in the new Red Army must be ...

205
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:17,240
specialists of the tsarist army.

206
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,170
They are professionals.

207
00:24:20,190 --> 00:24:24,110
And true patriots. -Do you offer to give again power

208
00:24:24,130 --> 00:24:29,120
in the army to the royal officers? -Exactly. And issue an open order.

209
00:24:30,220 --> 00:24:35,220
In case of treason of the tsar's officer, his family is subject to execution.

210
00:24:35,240 --> 00:24:40,240
-Nonsense! It is not for this that we have been preparing a class revolution for years,

211
00:24:41,010 --> 00:24:45,100
To submit to the same satraps, dressed in our form.

212
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:49,040
-I will support you.

213
00:24:51,050 --> 00:24:53,000
Take action.

214
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:04,150
-Where did you get such good fellows, Comrade Sermuk?

215
00:25:04,170 --> 00:25:08,030
-You yourself said, Lev Davidovich, the revolution should not only

216
00:25:08,050 --> 00:25:12,050
to terrify, but also to delight. -Allow me to introduce,

217
00:25:12,070 --> 00:25:15,190
Lev Davidovich. Larissa Reisner. My wife.

218
00:25:15,240 --> 00:25:18,190
It was seconded here by a military correspondent.

219
00:25:18,210 --> 00:25:23,080
-I remember. I read your wicked essay about me.

220
00:25:23,100 --> 00:25:27,040
-I must apologize for that article. Larissa is a poet. She was fond of

221
00:25:27,070 --> 00:25:30,110
anarchism and still can not get rid of maximalism

222
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:33,220
in their articles and publications. -You do not need to excuse yourself,

223
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,240
Comrade Raskolnikov.

224
00:25:37,040 --> 00:25:41,100
Think better about how you will create the Volga Flotilla.

225
00:25:42,220 --> 00:25:44,040
Ok?

226
00:25:44,170 --> 00:25:46,130
-With cars!

227
00:25:47,100 --> 00:25:51,080
Play "Whirlwinds of wicked war against us"

228
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:59,220
"Well, Lev Davidovich, now everything depends on you." The fate of the Russian

229
00:25:59,240 --> 00:26:04,020
and the world revolution is in your hands. Without exaggeration, I say.

230
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:09,030
-Koba, you're going to the front, too? -I do not have such a beautiful shape,

231
00:26:09,050 --> 00:26:12,140
as you do, Comrade Trotsky. But we both will do everything

232
00:26:12,160 --> 00:26:15,080
for our victory, right?

233
00:26:25,140 --> 00:26:28,230
-Well, where did you get to? - Daddy, give it to everyone there!

234
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,170
Mandatory

235
00:26:30,190 --> 00:26:35,000
- Dad, you will not be killed? -How will they kill me? Look,

236
00:26:35,020 --> 00:26:39,080
what armor I have. Not yet invented such a cannon to pierce it.

237
00:26:39,100 --> 00:26:41,110
Help your mother.

238
00:26:41,180 --> 00:26:43,060
I'll be back!

239
00:26:43,210 --> 00:26:45,200
-Do, what should, Lev.

240
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:47,190
THE GUYS OF STEAM LOADING

241
00:26:56,050 --> 00:26:57,160
-Sometimes, Dad!

242
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,080
"The telegraph has just brought bad news: Kazan has fallen.

243
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,090
So, if there is no miracle, the young Soviet Republic

244
00:27:12,110 --> 00:27:17,150
suffocated without bread and oil. For the most part the Red Army disintegrated,

245
00:27:17,170 --> 00:27:20,060
whole shelves are deserting.

246
00:27:20,080 --> 00:27:24,090
There is a premonition of a catastrophe in the air, which is why I feel so desperate

247
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,120
live and feel. "

248
00:27:36,060 --> 00:27:40,070
-Text start should be removed. For the future - no mention

249
00:27:40,090 --> 00:27:45,120
about defeat, no matter what happens. The situation of the Red Army at the front

250
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:49,240
firmly. Success is on our side. Our valiant troops are squeezing

251
00:27:50,010 --> 00:27:54,200
gangs of the enemy, and the European workers are about to drop the yoke of the world

252
00:27:54,220 --> 00:27:57,060
of capital. - Lev Davidovich!

253
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:59,180
-Yes. -Come on.

254
00:28:12,130 --> 00:28:16,070
-You clear? -Everything is clear, Lev Davidovich.

255
00:28:28,050 --> 00:28:31,120
"I'm afraid you can not go any further, Comrade Pre-Revolutionary Council."

256
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:35,080
Kappel broke into the rear, cut the branch, goes here.

257
00:28:35,100 --> 00:28:39,170
They know that you are here. Back too there is no way. There troops Komucha.

258
00:28:39,190 --> 00:28:42,020
-How much time do we have? -Not more than an hour.

259
00:28:42,140 --> 00:28:45,160
You can walk down the river. We expose one company to the barrage,

260
00:28:45,180 --> 00:28:48,150
with the rest we will try to move to Boguchaevsk.

261
00:28:57,020 --> 00:28:58,190
-I came to ...

262
00:29:00,090 --> 00:29:03,110
to stop the retreat.

263
00:29:03,130 --> 00:29:09,140
If I now escape, it completely demoralizes the army.

264
00:29:10,120 --> 00:29:12,120
-Stay, die.

265
00:29:13,230 --> 00:29:17,210
"Death is not the main thing." It is more important how to die.

266
00:29:18,090 --> 00:29:24,010
If I die fighting, it will be easier for my successor.

267
00:29:25,180 --> 00:29:28,170
"But we're not going to die with you."

268
00:29:36,100 --> 00:29:38,020
-Then hand over the weapon.

269
00:29:38,080 --> 00:29:40,100
Arrested. Both.

270
00:29:47,180 --> 00:29:49,160
Now

271
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:16,180
Soldiers obey us.

272
00:30:18,030 --> 00:30:19,150
{821}{}{Next.}

273
00:30:21,130 --> 00:30:23,230
What are you going to do next?

274
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:27,170
Are you deserting?

275
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,020
Dissolve the soldier, and where are you going?

276
00:30:33,040 --> 00:30:34,240
To Kappel?

277
00:30:36,110 --> 00:30:40,170
They will receive you there. In the chain - and on the front line.

278
00:30:41,100 --> 00:30:44,240
They really do not like defectors.

279
00:30:46,060 --> 00:30:49,020
One way or another, we will have to fight.

280
00:30:49,140 --> 00:30:52,110
And then perish. It's a question of time.

281
00:30:56,190 --> 00:30:58,010
WEAPON 1

282
00:30:58,030 --> 00:30:59,130
on the table!

283
00:31:20,050 --> 00:31:22,080
To the guardhouse of both.

284
00:31:22,100 --> 00:31:24,180
No. In the chain to the soldiers.

285
00:31:24,200 --> 00:31:27,120
The weapons must be dispatched immediately before the battle.

286
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:29,210
Take it away.

287
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:38,170
I advise you to change your clothes.

288
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,060
In something appropriate situation.

289
00:31:56,200 --> 00:31:59,150
-Patrons and grenades are enough. The problem with people.

290
00:31:59,170 --> 00:32:01,020
White is three times more.

291
00:32:01,050 --> 00:32:05,170
Samokatchiki will guard the passage from the train to the river in case ...

292
00:32:05,190 --> 00:32:11,020
-Stop off! All in the system. Everyone to one. Samokatchikov,

293
00:32:11,040 --> 00:32:13,090
stenographers, cooks - all!

294
00:32:13,210 --> 00:32:18,120
- Lev Davidovich, you have already been seen at the front, you will already be spoken about.

295
00:32:18,140 --> 00:32:21,220
Perhaps, we will carry out the evacuation of the command?

296
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:27,020
-I did not say clearly? All in the system! Running.

297
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:29,010
yes

298
00:32:30,220 --> 00:32:32,140
-Stock!

299
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:46,050
- Lev Davidovich, our only chance is defense.

300
00:32:46,070 --> 00:32:49,070
-They think so too, so they will not wait for us.

301
00:32:49,090 --> 00:32:51,240
Our only chance is a victory.

302
00:32:57,120 --> 00:33:03,100
They think we are afraid. But we sweep them, we are reversible

303
00:33:03,120 --> 00:33:09,060
Their own weapons against them themselves, if we do what we have from them

304
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:13,010
no one is waiting. We will attack ourselves.

305
00:33:18,220 --> 00:33:26,030
I, too, am afraid of death, like all of us. But I'll go there to survive.

306
00:33:26,050 --> 00:33:32,110
And if I'm fated to die, I'll die in battle for what I believe in.

307
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:38,090
-Step the march!

308
00:33:55,240 --> 00:33:57,160
BACK

309
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:12,000
- Lev Davidovich, our troops are retreating.

310
00:34:34,220 --> 00:34:36,210
-Here! Here!

311
00:34:43,030 --> 00:34:45,020
-Well, stand!

312
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:48,090
Stand! Where?!

313
00:34:48,110 --> 00:34:51,050
Forward went! Attack!

314
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,240
Soldiers, listen to me! We have already won, there is only one step left!

315
00:35:00,120 --> 00:35:04,090
Forward! Shoot them, fuck you!

316
00:35:04,180 --> 00:35:07,110
Attack, your mother!

317
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:14,240
Well done! Well done!

318
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:20,020
How nice!

319
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:34,050
VOICES: Hooray! Hooray!

320
00:35:45,170 --> 00:35:49,120
-Hush hush. Lie down. You can not get up, you are injured.

321
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,180
-We won? -Yes. The reinforcements came up,

322
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:57,160
and Kappel was dropped.

323
00:35:59,080 --> 00:36:05,150
I did not think you could do that. -Sit in the saddle? I grew up in a village,

324
00:36:05,170 --> 00:36:12,000
I love horses ... -And swear. You have them all so winged

325
00:36:12,020 --> 00:36:16,010
mat. So now soldiers can fully consider

326
00:36:16,030 --> 00:36:19,050
your father - after what you said about their mothers.

327
00:36:20,060 --> 00:36:27,120
-I had to dominate, and sexual power is the main force

328
00:36:27,140 --> 00:36:31,080
and the progenitor of power. - Did you read Freud?

329
00:36:31,100 --> 00:36:34,200
-It was. STOCK IN THE DOOR

330
00:36:34,220 --> 00:36:37,240
"Comrade Trotsky, the men are waiting."

331
00:36:49,060 --> 00:36:53,090
CHORUS: Hurray! Hooray!

332
00:36:58,030 --> 00:37:01,190
- "If any part willfully leave positions,

333
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,000
The commissar and the commander of the unit will be shot first.

334
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:08,120
Next - every tenth fighter.

335
00:37:08,140 --> 00:37:12,120
In case of desertion, every fifth person will be shot.

336
00:37:12,140 --> 00:37:17,170
Courageous and brave soldiers will be put on command posts.

337
00:37:17,190 --> 00:37:21,240
Cowards, self-seekers, traitors will not leave the bullet.

338
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:28,170
Death or victory. Trotsky. "

339
00:37:29,150 --> 00:37:31,110
STOCK IN THE DOOR

340
00:37:31,130 --> 00:37:33,200
- Comrade Trotsky, Raskolnikov.

341
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:39,030
-Lev Davidovich, Kazan is taken. The Red Army passed into a decisive

342
00:37:39,050 --> 00:37:41,040
offensive along the whole front.

343
00:37:49,070 --> 00:37:51,130
-Thank you, you're free.

344
00:38:07,020 --> 00:38:12,000
Sylvia, your fiance scared all the crocodiles around.

345
00:38:12,020 --> 00:38:16,210
You can not be afraid of anything, you will follow him like a stone wall.

346
00:38:16,230 --> 00:38:21,150
-All the amazing ability to not admit defeat,

347
00:38:21,170 --> 00:38:25,050
self-satisfied with victories. Where is your praised objectivity?

348
00:38:25,070 --> 00:38:28,200
-Objectivity is simple, Jackson. Everything that does not kill us does

349
00:38:28,220 --> 00:38:35,000
stronger. Still, Nietzsche was right. -Nietzsche finished his life in the shelter

350
00:38:35,020 --> 00:38:39,060
for the mentally ill. Do you want to finish like him? You are welcome,

351
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:43,050
live in a fantasy world. -Normal person is not able to

352
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:47,030
to turn the world upside down, to organize two revolutions and, at the same time,

353
00:38:47,050 --> 00:38:48,200
stay alive.

354
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:52,050
Look at me, Jackson, I'm alive. -True?

355
00:38:52,070 --> 00:38:54,100
-Yes. -You are 60 years old. You are an old man, exiled

356
00:38:54,120 --> 00:38:58,000
on the edge of the world, from where you are trying to fight the greatest politician

357
00:38:58,020 --> 00:39:01,140
modernity by writing memoirs that no one ever

358
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:04,240
will not read, because it's the memoirs of the defeated. And all because,

359
00:39:05,010 --> 00:39:08,140
that you do not know how and refuse to admit defeat. You think,

360
00:39:08,160 --> 00:39:11,180
are you still on horseback on your damned armored train?

361
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,090
Yes it's just ridiculous!

362
00:39:13,110 --> 00:39:16,160
Then why do I laugh alone from the two of us?

363
00:39:16,180 --> 00:39:21,180
Boo Boo Boo. A bad hour is already bu-bu-bu. -I had to give this to you.

364
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,030
in the morning, but ... -But I distracted you with my walk.

365
00:39:25,050 --> 00:39:27,040
I understand, I understand.

366
00:39:40,070 --> 00:39:46,240
"My dear, beloved Leo, you are a man of action." I too.

367
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:53,040
We do not have much time to live, and especially to you. We are both

368
00:39:53,060 --> 00:39:58,170
understand. I have money, and I do not see any more reason to stay here.

369
00:40:05,150 --> 00:40:10,230
Why do we, two loners, almost dead, hide, live in prisons

370
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:16,240
current lives? Let's leave and create a new one. Draw the remainder

371
00:40:17,010 --> 00:40:21,120
days as ordinary people - by the sea, in love and bliss.

372
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,210
I'll wait for you in our bar. If you do not come, I'll understand.

373
00:40:29,090 --> 00:40:35,070
I'll try to understand. But with you or without you, tomorrow I'm leaving.

374
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,070
Yours F. "

375
00:40:59,150 --> 00:41:03,190
-Why are you back? She must be waiting for you.

376
00:41:10,030 --> 00:41:17,130
-You see, Jackson, having left with Frida, I would admit that my former life

377
00:41:17,150 --> 00:41:20,130
is over and I will not be able to do anything else in it.

378
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,010
Hell no.

379
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:32,190
Hell no!

380
00:41:36,210 --> 00:41:38,210
Do you understand me?

381
00:41:44,080 --> 00:41:46,130
Hell no!

382
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:04,070
- Lev Davidovich ... - Comrade Pre-Revolutionary Council,

383
00:42:04,090 --> 00:42:08,000
Well, you did not warn? We would have prepared here.

384
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:10,100
-Care your people out.

385
00:42:12,110 --> 00:42:14,020
-What for? -We will have

386
00:42:14,040 --> 00:42:16,090
confidential conversation.

387
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:21,160
Comrade Voroshilov, are you in the same decisive battle?

388
00:42:23,190 --> 00:42:25,070
140 Let's go!

389
00:42:26,190 --> 00:42:29,090
-I did not ask you to sit down!

390
00:42:30,090 --> 00:42:34,070
And put yourself in order when talking to the chairman

391
00:42:34,090 --> 00:42:36,220
Revolutionary Military Council.

392
00:42:39,200 --> 00:42:44,010
I have one question for you. Are you going to sabotage my orders?

393
00:42:44,030 --> 00:42:47,230
-I obey those orders that I consider necessary.

394
00:42:48,180 --> 00:42:52,100
-In that case, you're under arrest. Going to Moscow.

395
00:42:56,220 --> 00:43:01,060
-Here my people are everywhere. You will be wiped out in powder.

396
00:43:07,240 --> 00:43:09,190
-Your truth is yours.

397
00:43:16,230 --> 00:43:18,240
We will execute here.

398
00:43:23,050 --> 00:43:27,090
-T-Comrade Trotsky, I simply carried out the order.

399
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:29,160
Whose order? -Stalina.

400
00:43:31,180 --> 00:43:33,120
- Stalin? -Yes.

401
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:41,120
-You are the commander of the front. Stalin is seconded to you

402
00:43:41,140 --> 00:43:44,130
just as the head of the food part.

403
00:43:44,150 --> 00:43:47,060
Do you follow the orders of the quartermaster?

404
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:52,060
-He is the hero of the revolution, a member of the Council of People's Commissars.

405
00:43:53,000 --> 00:43:58,090
-You heard? Koba is now the hero of the revolution. Find and bring

406
00:43:58,110 --> 00:44:00,240
to me this hero. This - under arrest.

407
00:44:12,130 --> 00:44:15,160
"Lev Davidovich, will you?" -Yes.

408
00:44:15,180 --> 00:44:17,130
-Progress. Stand still.

409
00:44:20,000 --> 00:44:23,110
-I'm going to put out the light, Comrade Trotsky.

410
00:44:23,130 --> 00:44:28,050
We are bombed from airplanes. - What else do you advise me?

411
00:44:29,050 --> 00:44:33,210
Do not stand there, Koba, sit down. You know that thanks to

412
00:44:33,230 --> 00:44:39,030
To the former tsarist military specialists, our army has finally begun

413
00:44:39,050 --> 00:44:44,200
to win? With the exception of the front commanded by the hero

414
00:44:44,220 --> 00:44:47,080
Revolution commissar Koba.

415
00:44:47,100 --> 00:44:49,130
BOMBING

416
00:44:51,030 --> 00:44:55,030
You hear me? -I already told you,

417
00:44:55,050 --> 00:45:00,060
Comrade Trotsky ... It was not for that that we did the revolution to immediately lie down

418
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:02,090
under the former royal officers.

419
00:45:03,090 --> 00:45:08,130
- Damn it, Koba! You were, as they were, and remain an ex, small

420
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:13,090
a criminal with the psychology of a shopkeeper. You do not understand a thing in politics,

421
00:45:13,110 --> 00:45:16,100
nor in military strategy. Where are you going?

422
00:45:16,120 --> 00:45:19,200
"Do not talk to me like that, Comrade Trotsky."

423
00:45:19,220 --> 00:45:25,010
-I shoot you and Voroshilov from the front. Get out to Moscow.

424
00:45:25,170 --> 00:45:28,000
And do not get in the way - I'll crush it.

425
00:45:33,070 --> 00:45:35,090
BOMBING

426
00:45:35,180 --> 00:45:39,080
-You know, Comrade Trotsky ...

427
00:45:41,010 --> 00:45:46,010
you are right: in Moscow, I really can do more than here.

428
00:45:46,030 --> 00:45:50,110
Just want to tell you at last one parable.

429
00:45:52,020 --> 00:45:58,180
Once a proud eagle circled above the Caucasus mountains, and down in the lake

430
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:04,040
swam wild ducks. The eagle wanted to catch one of them and rushed

431
00:46:04,060 --> 00:46:09,230
down, but the duck had time to dive into the water, and the eagle was left with nothing.

432
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:15,170
The eagle was very angry, flew high again to the very sun

433
00:46:15,190 --> 00:46:20,160
and, folding his wings, threw himself down with a stone. "This time you will not leave

434
00:46:20,180 --> 00:46:26,010
from me! "- shouted the eagle and also dived into the lake.

435
00:46:26,030 --> 00:46:30,050
he began to choke and almost choked.

436
00:46:30,070 --> 00:46:34,150
And the duck at that time quietly waved its wings and flew up.

437
00:46:35,090 --> 00:46:39,240
"Look, an eagle, I'm fine myself

438
00:46:40,010 --> 00:46:46,110
I feel in your sky, and you do not choke in my lake. "

439
00:46:48,000 --> 00:46:53,030
- An instructive parable. Only I'm not an eagle, but a lion.

440
00:46:53,230 --> 00:46:56,150
-So I'm not a duck either.

441
00:46:58,070 --> 00:47:02,110
-You know, Koba, I also remembered the old parable.

442
00:47:03,060 --> 00:47:08,160
Once the jackal came to the lion and said: "Let's fight".

443
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:14,150
The Lion grinned and turned away. And the jackal threatened him: "I'll tell everyone,

444
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:20,200
that the lion was frightened of me. "The lion yawned and replied:" Let the beasts condemn

445
00:47:20,220 --> 00:47:27,020
me for cowardice, but they will not be scorned all my life for killing a jackal. "

446
00:47:30,230 --> 00:47:34,160
-I'll tell you to turn off the light after all.

447
00:48:00,060 --> 00:48:04,110
-Nata, you go, I'll work a little more.

448
00:48:29,090 --> 00:48:34,160
-Did you ever think about how this will happen?

449
00:48:39,240 --> 00:48:42,080
-No never.

450
00:48:44,220 --> 00:48:46,160
I don't believe it.

451
00:48:47,120 --> 00:48:51,160
You are too old to last long.

452
00:48:53,010 --> 00:48:55,200
And too Trotsky to die in bed.

453
00:48:56,180 --> 00:49:01,060
You think. Maybe, that's all you think about.

454
00:49:02,050 --> 00:49:10,010
-Anyway, your way of avoiding responsibility is definitely not for me.

455
00:49:11,010 --> 00:49:17,180
This is, rather, a manifestation of weakness. - In my case - maybe.

456
00:49:19,090 --> 00:49:23,030
But in your position it would be an example of courage.

457
00:49:31,060 --> 00:49:32,210
More courageous.

458
00:50:04,190 --> 00:50:06,110
THE GOLDEN SHOES

459
00:50:18,180 --> 00:50:20,240
I have not expected anything else from you.

460
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:27,200
I'm already dead. Like everything else you lived in, Trotsky.

461
00:50:32,220 --> 00:50:33,230
Boo!
