00:00:05,180 --> 00:00:10,060
OVER THE SUBTITLES WORKED: K. FREGER, M. LEVIN, I. CIRIC, A. PRYAKH

2
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:03,070
-Lev, are you alive?

3
00:01:38,120 --> 00:01:41,110
Lyova, where are you going? You are crazy?

4
00:01:43,010 --> 00:01:47,120
What are you doing? Do you think you can win by making it easier for his mercenaries?

5
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,050
Trotsky has won, because he has beautifully left, right?

6
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:53,220
Hell no! Do not even hope to give up so easily, I will not give you

7
00:01:53,240 --> 00:01:57,000
so take it and ... - Natasha! I'll give in when I start it

8
00:01:57,020 --> 00:02:00,180
to be afraid. How do you not understand? He will win exactly on the day when

9
00:02:00,200 --> 00:02:06,170
Leon Trotsky will stop walking where he wants, when he wants, where he wants.

10
00:02:07,230 --> 00:02:11,140
-I heard the shots! - They did not hit me. ABOUT! ABOUT!

11
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:15,050
- Lev Davidovich, you better return. -Three! So so so...

12
00:02:15,070 --> 00:02:17,180
- Lev Davidovich! - Leo, let's go home.

13
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:37,020
SPANISH: SeÃ±or, are you okay? -All is well. This I failed

14
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:39,210
the victim of an attempt.

15
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:45,040
I, as always, have not a single scratch.

16
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:47,230
-Yes, I'm sorry for the poor fellow. -Thank you.

17
00:02:48,070 --> 00:02:52,010
"But, frankly, Trotsky, you always endangered

18
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:55,180
everyone who was near. -Only do not blame me for this.

19
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,210
It was not I who destroyed everyone who at least once shook my hand. I did not send

20
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:04,150
in the camp of thousands of innocent people. I do not send killers at night.

21
00:03:05,060 --> 00:03:08,160
"Do you really think it's Stalin, yes?" Come on, Trotsky,

22
00:03:08,180 --> 00:03:12,020
you flatter yourself. He has already defeated you for a long time - why should he now

23
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,000
to hunt you? You are not dangerous to him. "You do not understand anything, Jackson.

24
00:03:17,020 --> 00:03:21,010
I will be dangerous to him for the rest of my life. Even if I do not say another word,

25
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,200
even if I humble myself. And I will not be humble. It's a boomerang, Jackson.

26
00:03:27,140 --> 00:03:29,190
-What are you carrying? What boomerang?

27
00:03:31,020 --> 00:03:36,200
-I created the Golem, and it will not stop until it destroys

28
00:03:36,220 --> 00:03:38,110
own creator.

29
00:04:46,070 --> 00:04:47,180
-Help!

30
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:13,120
-Take it.

31
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,020
ON-GEORGIAN: -What are you going to open? Finger?

32
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,170
L

33
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,030
-And all these gilded epaulettes with gray whiskers, and all

34
00:05:45,050 --> 00:05:49,240
oak-headed chauvinists, wiping breeches in halls with stucco molding

35
00:05:50,010 --> 00:05:55,000
and bas-reliefs, and all who press a working free thought,

36
00:05:55,020 --> 00:06:01,050
we want to say one thing: do you really think that you can sleep peacefully?

37
00:06:01,070 --> 00:06:06,040
No, we will come to you and give you a heavy kick in the ass!

38
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:12,180
Because we are stronger, we are younger and we are right! And the future is ours!

39
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,020
I tell you this, Leon Trotsky!

40
00:06:34,090 --> 00:06:38,080
-Marxist? -S-with-sympathizer.

41
00:06:39,090 --> 00:06:42,230
-Why do we work for the exploiters, comrade sympathizing?

42
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:49,030
- I have a mother, sister. I have one. -Ah, you bastard! Ugh!

43
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:57,010
-Mother, sister ... Family is a hindrance for a revolutionary.

44
00:06:59,010 --> 00:07:03,220
We do not need sympathizers. We need supporters.

45
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:27,060
(shot)

46
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:39,140
Excellent, comrade-in-arms.

47
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,130
-Natalya, hello!

48
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:24,150
-Trotsky, do you watch me? -Fair? Yes. I want to ask you

49
00:08:24,170 --> 00:08:25,230
one question.

50
00:08:39,190 --> 00:08:41,000
Ask us.

51
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:48,040
-Do you want some fruit?

52
00:08:49,230 --> 00:08:51,140
Ok.

53
00:08:55,100 --> 00:09:01,100
Why do you think our meetings are boring?

54
00:09:04,120 --> 00:09:09,200
-You are in Europe, Trotsky. Here museums, exhibitions, theaters, life beats the key.

55
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:12,240
And you sit in smoke-filled cafes and talk about changes.

56
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,080
How can you change a life you do not know and do not see?

57
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:23,010
-Yes, you are right. I do not know this life. I spent four years

58
00:09:23,030 --> 00:09:26,190
in exile - there are no museums, no theaters. There many people

59
00:09:26,210 --> 00:09:30,110
there is not even a future. They do not need to live, because they have no purpose.

60
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:33,020
And I want to give them this goal.

61
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:39,090
-Freude? -Yes.

62
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:43,060
-Surprisingly for a revolutionary. -You decided to study. This is now

63
00:09:43,080 --> 00:09:45,060
fashionable. - Freud is busy.

64
00:09:45,080 --> 00:09:48,200
His reasoning about sexuality is a bit shocking,

65
00:09:48,220 --> 00:09:51,150
but the acuity of the mind is uncommon.

66
00:09:55,070 --> 00:09:56,180
Goodbye.

67
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:01,040
Natasha

68
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:09,220
Well, suppose I want to see this other side of your life.

69
00:10:10,010 --> 00:10:13,170
Me where to start? -Well, for example, tonight

70
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,100
I'm invited to a friend in the souare. You too can join.

71
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:23,210
-And what is soare? -Soviet Route.

72
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:26,230
-I'll think about it.

73
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:21,200
-Hey! Trotsky, but you know how to surprise. - My God, Natalie!

74
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,000
Finally, you're here too! How glad I am to see you.

75
00:11:25,150 --> 00:11:29,020
- Good evening, Noel. Meet me: this is my friend Lev Trotsky.

76
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:30,210
-Good!

77
00:11:38,060 --> 00:11:41,100
When he gets angry, he's even more beautiful. I'm just for a minute.

78
00:12:03,220 --> 00:12:06,170
"Now look, you're ready to burn it."

79
00:12:06,190 --> 00:12:11,050
-I'm ready. And not only him alone. All of them.

80
00:12:11,070 --> 00:12:14,220
"You want to burn me, too, Trotsky?"

81
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:21,200
Be silent. I think I understand you. In you there lives a small deprived

82
00:12:21,220 --> 00:12:25,180
a child who did not get something - mind, charm, will.

83
00:12:25,200 --> 00:12:30,070
And for the sake of your petty resentment, you are ready to destroy all those who are better than you. So?

84
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:40,030
-You indulge your dirty vices, dooming other people to poverty

85
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:44,240
and humiliation. People who work hard to survive by themselves

86
00:12:45,010 --> 00:12:50,210
and provide you with this foul polish. And you consider yourself better than them.

87
00:12:50,230 --> 00:12:55,230
No, you are the children who hid here from real life.

88
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,160
But the storm is close. And when it hits you, you are very

89
00:13:00,180 --> 00:13:05,050
wonder how long you managed to steal all these people.

90
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:18,200
I apologize. Apparently, I'm not created for this. I wish good

91
00:13:18,220 --> 00:13:20,110
evenings all.

92
00:13:23,010 --> 00:13:25,210
-Trogsky! Wait, wait!

93
00:13:27,060 --> 00:13:30,190
- How's your ward? - Everything goes according to plan, Herr Kobert.

94
00:13:31,130 --> 00:13:34,160
It is already being printed in newspapers. -Very good.

95
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:38,080
-I organized several speeches before the Socialist-Revolutionaries.

96
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:42,110
It is rapidly gaining popularity. But I have invested very much

97
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,230
much money. -It's not a problem.

98
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:52,150
I remind you, we do not have much time.

99
00:13:54,150 --> 00:13:57,040
-A ... -Don't worry. It will still be.

100
00:13:58,010 --> 00:14:03,030
What are you thinking of doing now? -I think that after the speech

101
00:14:03,050 --> 00:14:06,050
at the congress he will become a real political figure.

102
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:10,020
-But without the patronage of Lenin, he is unlikely to be able to speak.

103
00:14:10,200 --> 00:14:14,170
-About this, I also took care. -Very good.

104
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,120
- My father is a good man, but he is patriarchal.

105
00:14:20,100 --> 00:14:23,220
So I did not want to live in his golden cage and wait for me

106
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,160
will be successfully married in order to give birth to a bunch of children, and fled -

107
00:14:27,180 --> 00:14:32,230
to study in Europe. -My also refused to understand me.

108
00:14:33,170 --> 00:14:37,230
It's funny, I'm an adult, and I, like a boy, want him

109
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,140
was proud of me and that he understood what I wanted.

110
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,120
-When acting contrary to the will of the parents, do we feel that we are betraying their love?

111
00:14:47,140 --> 00:14:51,210
-May be. I know that I'm right, but I feel some kind of guilt in front of him.

112
00:14:51,230 --> 00:14:53,110
A paradox!

113
00:14:53,230 --> 00:14:55,120
Danger!

114
00:14:56,110 --> 00:15:00,070
I'm not interrupting you, young people? -Not at all. We were at my friend's -

115
00:15:00,090 --> 00:15:03,090
Lev asked to show him the real European life.

116
00:15:03,110 --> 00:15:07,170
-ABOUT! And I have a surprise for you, Trotsky. Gift.

117
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:15,060
-What is it? -Mandate of the deputy of the congress in Brussels.

118
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:23,070
To me Lenin secretly said that he wants to make you a member

119
00:15:23,090 --> 00:15:28,030
editorial board of the newspaper Iskra. -But I'm not ...

120
00:15:28,050 --> 00:15:31,010
-I know nothing. Have a nice evening.

121
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,070
-The Lord, checking documents.

122
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,100
STRESSED MUSIC

123
00:16:16,080 --> 00:16:18,080
-What are we sitting on? Document.

124
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,190
- "Wah-tang Mirh ... ... wali".

125
00:16:35,020 --> 00:16:37,220
Mr. Officer! -Well, what have you got there?

126
00:16:50,030 --> 00:16:51,110
Let's go.

127
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:43,230
-You generally attribute a lot to yourself in reverse. Already Stalin

128
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,170
ostensibly you have created. -Do you know Koba

129
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:55,010
was engaged only in exas. There was, as he put it, a laborer

130
00:17:55,030 --> 00:17:57,000
revolution. Yours.

131
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:03,080
And from my articles he concluded that the decisive step would be

132
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:07,230
not for the well-fed intelligentsia, but for those like him,

133
00:18:08,190 --> 00:18:13,190
people ready to shed blood. -And if Stalin is really

134
00:18:13,210 --> 00:18:17,040
such a monster, as you say about it, how did you overlook it,

135
00:18:17,060 --> 00:18:21,070
with your vaunted flair? -People with whom I then

136
00:18:21,090 --> 00:18:24,190
communicated, were much more difficult.

137
00:18:26,090 --> 00:18:31,150
I thought that the real danger would come from them.

138
00:19:34,110 --> 00:19:39,000
-A, Lev. I did not expect you today. -Vladimir Ilyich, I read

139
00:19:39,020 --> 00:19:43,030
your notes to my theses for the speech at the congress.

140
00:19:43,140 --> 00:19:47,050
This is an obvious twitching. Plekhanov did not say that.

141
00:19:47,070 --> 00:19:50,210
And even more so I did not write. - Well, to hell with the old donkey.

142
00:19:51,030 --> 00:19:54,150
He did not say so, but he thinks so. And we will throw it aside.

143
00:19:56,020 --> 00:20:01,080
-Then I would like to get acquainted with the theses of your speech.

144
00:20:02,060 --> 00:20:05,150
- What's that for? -To be sure,

145
00:20:05,170 --> 00:20:08,140
that you, like me, are not afraid to get your hands dirty.

146
00:20:14,170 --> 00:20:18,220
- Would you like to lift the visor? Excuse me.

147
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:22,210
I am the head, and you are the tool. I say you are doing it.

148
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:26,140
Do not doubt, do not ask questions, do not make yourself offended

149
00:20:26,160 --> 00:20:31,210
institute, but you do it. It is clear? -In that case, look for yourself.

150
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:36,020
Another weapon. But I have my own head.

151
00:20:43,050 --> 00:20:44,100
What do you ..."

152
00:20:46,180 --> 00:20:50,100
-Your life is in my hands! And, if I squeeze them, you will not be

153
00:20:50,120 --> 00:20:53,230
neither as a person, nor as a politician. So you will do what

154
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:57,050
I ask. Otherwise, there will be no sincere speeches at the congresses,

155
00:20:57,070 --> 00:20:58,220
nor walks in the parks.

156
00:21:06,150 --> 00:21:07,170
Go away.

157
00:21:17,220 --> 00:21:19,070
-It was not possible ...

158
00:21:21,150 --> 00:21:24,200
... scare me. Failed. Moreover, I understood,

159
00:21:24,220 --> 00:21:28,140
that you are afraid of me. I will become a new leader.

160
00:21:29,100 --> 00:21:35,070
And people will follow me, not for you. And one day you crawl to me

161
00:21:35,090 --> 00:21:37,060
with the proposal of union.

162
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:23,000
-You are charming.

163
00:23:25,060 --> 00:23:27,010
-Hello, Natalia.

164
00:23:30,230 --> 00:23:35,240
-Hello, Lev. So you like to watch from the outside?

165
00:23:39,000 --> 00:23:44,170
-Well, some of these paintings will be seen by hundreds, maybe even thousands of spectators.

166
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:47,010
So, consider that I am one of the first.

167
00:23:47,030 --> 00:23:51,240
-Do you condemn me? - You do not know me well, Natalia.

168
00:23:52,010 --> 00:23:55,100
I am deeply convinced that no one has the right to point out to a woman,

169
00:23:55,120 --> 00:23:59,180
how she should dispose of her body. All this is the morality of the past,

170
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,180
but I aspire to the future. -This is the future of which you

171
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:05,080
are you dreaming, immoral?

172
00:24:06,160 --> 00:24:10,220
-The woman herself will decide,

173
00:24:11,150 --> 00:24:13,100
who should get her body.

174
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:19,000
Her body, her feelings. And, if at full freedom of choice it is still

175
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:22,180
decides that it will belong to a single person ...

176
00:24:24,030 --> 00:24:28,020
At least, it will be sincere, than all this false morals.

177
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:35,220
Well, besides, it's just beautiful. -Yes it is.

178
00:24:37,020 --> 00:24:42,180
And that's why I'm here. And you are right - I decide who I will belong to.

179
00:24:46,130 --> 00:24:50,190
-I remember you talked about sympathy for Freud.

180
00:24:51,170 --> 00:24:52,240
You are welcome.

181
00:24:58,200 --> 00:25:00,060
- Freud's lecture? -Yes.

182
00:25:00,210 --> 00:25:05,040
- But it's in Vienna. -Yes. The train leaves in an hour.

183
00:25:05,090 --> 00:25:07,120
If we hurry, we can make it.

184
00:25:25,160 --> 00:25:27,140
- Will you soon have a congress?

185
00:25:31,110 --> 00:25:37,110
-Quite right. Directly from Vienna, I'm going to Brussels. Want with me?

186
00:25:39,100 --> 00:25:41,060
- To Brussels? -Yes.

187
00:25:42,190 --> 00:25:44,220
-Boredom. STOCK IN THE DOOR

188
00:25:44,240 --> 00:25:46,100
Yes.

189
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:51,100
-Madam, monsieur, checking passports.

190
00:26:09,210 --> 00:26:14,100
Hristo ... Sama ... Som ... Samoksa ...

191
00:26:15,150 --> 00:26:17,190
-Christo Samakalov.

192
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,190
We, the Bulgarians, have complicated surnames.

193
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:28,210
-Madam the Sedovaya. Monsieur Samako ...

194
00:26:30,010 --> 00:26:32,020
"Do not even try." Good luck.

195
00:26:36,140 --> 00:26:37,220
WHISPER: Trotsky!

196
00:26:38,110 --> 00:26:40,010
Damn, what does this mean?

197
00:26:40,230 --> 00:26:44,110
- Boring everyday life of an ordinary Social-Democrat.

198
00:26:48,180 --> 00:26:53,060
-And nevertheless mediocre professors from academic communities

199
00:26:53,080 --> 00:26:55,000
continue to assure us that,

200
00:26:55,020 --> 00:26:59,080
that human behavior is controlled

201
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:02,020
reason, ideals and rules of conduct.

202
00:27:03,170 --> 00:27:10,080
What nonsense. What an old stupidity. I insist that behavior

203
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:14,240
Man is governed by two institutions: the fear of death

204
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:18,220
and sexual attraction. -And money?

205
00:27:19,060 --> 00:27:24,180
-Money, my friend, is the simplest, I would say, the most vulgar

206
00:27:24,200 --> 00:27:28,040
reflection of sexual desire. -And dreams?

207
00:27:30,160 --> 00:27:32,110
Do not we control dreams?

208
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:40,040
-It should upset you, young Fraulein, but your dreams are also nothing more than

209
00:27:40,220 --> 00:27:43,220
a kind of sexual attraction.

210
00:27:45,180 --> 00:27:51,140
Sex is any motivation for activity. The basis of actions

211
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:56,010
millionaire and a dreamer is the same as the basis for action

212
00:27:56,030 --> 00:27:58,080
persistent lover ...

213
00:28:00,020 --> 00:28:03,110
Prove your worth, master ...

214
00:28:07,000 --> 00:28:08,110
... and cover.

215
00:28:13,240 --> 00:28:16,240
For example, do you know what your satellite is dreaming about?

216
00:28:17,010 --> 00:28:19,130
-On the world revolution. LAUGHTER IN THE ROOM

217
00:28:19,190 --> 00:28:21,020
-Congratulations.

218
00:28:23,070 --> 00:28:27,010
For example, in that dull gentleman, sexual attraction is expressed

219
00:28:27,030 --> 00:28:31,170
in the money. And in order to master you, your male is ready

220
00:28:31,190 --> 00:28:38,020
burn half the world! For him, so to speak, sex is a revolution!

221
00:28:39,110 --> 00:28:43,020
Sexual attraction underlies not only personal,

222
00:28:43,040 --> 00:28:46,140
but also social relations. What they feel for each other

223
00:28:46,160 --> 00:28:50,150
man and woman, are experienced by various subjects of society.

224
00:28:50,170 --> 00:28:53,200
The struggle for power is, in fact, a struggle for a woman.

225
00:28:53,220 --> 00:28:57,150
And the subordination of subjects to the rulers is based ...

226
00:28:57,170 --> 00:28:59,000
-In fear.

227
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:08,080
- Partly. But in no less degree - on love in the sexiest

228
00:29:08,100 --> 00:29:12,150
sense of the word. Make the masses want you -

229
00:29:12,170 --> 00:29:16,080
and they will change for you the slope of the earth's axis.

230
00:29:21,210 --> 00:29:23,170
Questions, ladies and gentlemen?

231
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:27,100
I ask you, Herr the revolutionary.

232
00:29:30,100 --> 00:29:34,090
-You talked with us for two hours,

233
00:29:34,220 --> 00:29:38,110
kept in suspense. For us there was no one,

234
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:44,110
except you. Does it follow from this that all those present in this room

235
00:29:45,060 --> 00:29:48,010
you wanted? LAUGHTER IN THE ROOM

236
00:29:51,220 --> 00:29:54,230
-I would say that you have simplified my theory too much.

237
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:58,000
But if you put the question this way, then answer it yourself,

238
00:29:58,020 --> 00:30:01,010
only honestly. I answered this question for myself.

239
00:30:01,180 --> 00:30:06,060
I did not want you. I'm a normal man.

240
00:30:06,150 --> 00:30:11,070
But you could not answer my question neither "yes", nor "no".

241
00:30:11,090 --> 00:30:16,200
Would answer "yes" - would be in vain. Would answer "no" - only

242
00:30:16,220 --> 00:30:20,160
would confirm the falsity of your theory.

243
00:30:25,110 --> 00:30:29,080
Nevertheless, I did not leave. I listened to you

244
00:30:31,010 --> 00:30:34,120
with a sinking heart. Do you know why?

245
00:30:36,030 --> 00:30:40,170
Because you ... are right. Paradox.

246
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:48,140
-Our paradoxes are our life.

247
00:30:55,170 --> 00:30:59,020
-He is either a genius or a maniac, obsessed with sex.

248
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:02,200
In any case, he can shock. -Shock?

249
00:31:04,050 --> 00:31:08,210
And is it possible to shock a woman posing naked

250
00:31:08,230 --> 00:31:12,200
before a dozen men? -I have to earn,

251
00:31:12,220 --> 00:31:17,080
not to be obligated to Parvus. And there is no

252
00:31:17,100 --> 00:31:20,150
sexual overtones. -In Freud's opinion, sexy

253
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:23,060
subtext is everywhere. -Herr revolutionary!

254
00:31:28,050 --> 00:31:32,200
You represent a very rare type of sexual aggressor.

255
00:31:34,230 --> 00:31:38,220
You tried to trap me just to shake

256
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:41,230
my authority in the eyes of the crowd. But, after seeing my hitch,

257
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,030
immediately threw me a lifebuoy. "I beg your pardon, Mr. Freud,

258
00:31:46,050 --> 00:31:50,130
if my is not a very serious matter ...

259
00:31:50,150 --> 00:31:54,050
-You have a critical mind, you do not succumb to advertising, on you

260
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,240
the laws of the crowd do not apply. But your psychotype is usually peculiar,

261
00:31:59,010 --> 00:32:03,090
attacking, already killing, but something prevents you from completing the started

262
00:32:03,110 --> 00:32:08,080
an act of sexual aggression. Yes, yes, maybe, weakness ...

263
00:32:09,150 --> 00:32:14,210
-I extended my hand to the drowning, choked

264
00:32:14,230 --> 00:32:18,100
in their own demagoguery. You call it weakness?

265
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:24,140
- How quickly your pupils narrow. This reaction I met

266
00:32:24,160 --> 00:32:29,140
only two types of people - serial killers and religious fanatics.

267
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:33,220
You can become both if you learn to defeat your weaknesses.

268
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:38,160
- I'm not interested in fighting weakness. I'm interested

269
00:32:38,180 --> 00:32:44,130
to struggle with force. Farewell. -Do you stay in Vienna for long? I would like

270
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,230
learn more about you. Next time, Mr. Freud.

271
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,160
I'm waiting in Brussels.

272
00:32:52,030 --> 00:32:53,110
SPEAKS IN SPANISH

273
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:57,050
Hello, Jose.

274
00:32:58,090 --> 00:33:02,070
"Leo, have not seen you for a long time, my friend." Glad always!

275
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:05,240
- I'm not alone today, I'm with Frank. We'll work, we'll work for you

276
00:33:06,010 --> 00:33:09,150
in four hands. - And do not think to argue, amigo!

277
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:12,050
You're crazy, but I like it.

278
00:33:12,070 --> 00:33:14,220
-Thank you. -Hey, come here.

279
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:21,170
-Hose wonderful man, he prepares wonderful quesadillas.

280
00:33:22,130 --> 00:33:26,070
From time to time I run from my desk.

281
00:33:26,090 --> 00:33:29,190
Very much helps to get rid of bad thoughts.

282
00:33:34,100 --> 00:33:37,040
Are not you afraid to get your hands dirty?

283
00:33:38,010 --> 00:33:41,240
-Not afraid. -Great. Join now.

284
00:33:42,010 --> 00:33:46,160
Surprised, did not expect to see Trotsky rolling out the dough?

285
00:33:46,220 --> 00:33:51,090
-From what? Hitler is an artist, Mussolini is an enthusiastic motorist.

286
00:33:51,220 --> 00:33:56,190
No. From this they do not cease to be Hitler and Mussolini. Than you are better?

287
00:33:57,130 --> 00:34:03,120
-You know, pictures, cars are all habits of superhumans.

288
00:34:03,140 --> 00:34:07,150
Quesadilla is more primitive, more relevant to the soil,

289
00:34:07,170 --> 00:34:11,000
on which ordinary people walk. -You are confused in the testimony,

290
00:34:11,020 --> 00:34:14,070
Comrade Trotsky. Just as yesterday you talked about yourself as

291
00:34:14,090 --> 00:34:18,100
about the superman who superseded God himself. And now you say the opposite.

292
00:34:18,120 --> 00:34:23,030
"Your blinkers, Frank, make you see the contradictions, even in those cases,

293
00:34:23,050 --> 00:34:26,180
when there are none. Yes, I was a superman in order to decide

294
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:30,180
tasks that ordinary people can not do. Then I could not allow

295
00:34:30,200 --> 00:34:35,030
to contemplate itself for the cooking. And now I can.

296
00:34:35,220 --> 00:34:39,060
But at any time, if necessary, I will again become a god.

297
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:44,150
You know, idols at close examination disappoint.

298
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:49,120
And the more powerful the deity, the stronger the disappointment.

299
00:34:49,140 --> 00:34:53,170
-Convenient logic to substitute faith and not to get stuck on such trifles,

300
00:34:53,190 --> 00:34:59,050
as devotion. "I've always believed the same thing all my life.

301
00:34:59,070 --> 00:35:01,200
For me, the revolution was always a god.

302
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:04,130
-For me as well. -Nothing like this!

303
00:35:04,150 --> 00:35:08,060
You personified it with your Stalin,

304
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:12,110
squeezed into the framework of personality. This is normal for ordinary people.

305
00:35:12,130 --> 00:35:16,080
That's why we build myths around our names.

306
00:35:17,070 --> 00:35:20,230
Actually, if you think about it, it's you, not I'm real

307
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:26,090
apostates. It's you, at the first call of the leader, believe in him, not in the idea.

308
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:28,240
I never succumbed to this.

309
00:35:29,110 --> 00:35:36,030
I always saw people in the leaders. And, unfortunately, not always

310
00:35:36,050 --> 00:35:38,230
the very best. Alas!

311
00:35:47,110 --> 00:35:48,240
SHEPOT: Trotsky is coming.

312
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:54,200
- Hello, Vladimir Ilyich.

313
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,170
"You should not have dressed like that, Trotsky. The Plenum of the Congress adopted a decision

314
00:36:01,190 --> 00:36:03,230
about canceling your speech.

315
00:36:07,080 --> 00:36:11,020
I thought ... and I'm ready to do what you asked for.

316
00:36:24,150 --> 00:36:26,230
-Your speech.

317
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,190
Thank you.

318
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,200
Comrade Trotsky has a word.

319
00:36:43,110 --> 00:36:49,140
- Comrades! I, Lev Trotsky, escaped from exile, passed through hell

320
00:36:49,160 --> 00:36:54,210
Tsar's prison, who saw the degradation of the Russian people and the Russian

321
00:36:54,230 --> 00:37:00,020
I consider it my duty to turn to revolutionaries.

322
00:37:00,040 --> 00:37:03,130
True, there are not many of them here. DISSATISFIED COUNTRIES

323
00:37:05,210 --> 00:37:09,060
They settled around Paris, Berlin, London!

324
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:13,050
You chat, write articles! Fat swim!

325
00:37:13,070 --> 00:37:19,090
You can not save the peasants and send workers, sitting in a coffee house!

326
00:37:19,110 --> 00:37:23,220
You can not, with a cup of coffee, arm the proletariat!

327
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:26,040
Look at yourself - are not you ashamed?

328
00:37:26,060 --> 00:37:29,080
Yes you are all here ... impotent!

329
00:37:29,100 --> 00:37:35,160
You do not fight! You imitate the struggle, thereby discrediting

330
00:37:35,180 --> 00:37:41,190
the great idea of âârevolution. Comrade Plekhanov, and it is convenient for you

331
00:37:41,210 --> 00:37:45,240
to talk about the revolution with a full stomach?

332
00:37:46,010 --> 00:37:50,120
Does not it make you jump? A Russian peasant suffers.

333
00:37:50,140 --> 00:37:55,060
Let him wait for another revolution, in highly developed Europe.

334
00:37:55,080 --> 00:37:58,170
Is not that so, Georgi Valentinovich? -Are you finished?

335
00:37:58,190 --> 00:38:01,020
-You, comrade Lenin, what are you smiling at?

336
00:38:01,040 --> 00:38:06,170
Than you are better? Sit in the same coffeehouse at a nearby table

337
00:38:06,190 --> 00:38:11,190
and weave intrigues. You are just as impotent as everyone else.

338
00:38:11,210 --> 00:38:18,090
The Russian revolution tired of tolerating the helplessness of the Paris and Vienna

339
00:38:18,110 --> 00:38:23,030
roosters. She needs new leaders, new fighters.

340
00:38:23,050 --> 00:38:25,030
-Well done! -Mold-of-war Trotsky!

341
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:28,230
- She, like a woman, is waiting for a real man. Enough talk!

342
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:34,170
It is time for the Russian revolution. Be a man,

343
00:38:34,190 --> 00:38:41,130
impregnate it, and it will be born of a new, just world.

344
00:38:41,150 --> 00:38:43,050
"Bravo"

345
00:38:43,070 --> 00:38:48,240
-Plox is a revolutionary who can not become a street extremist!

346
00:38:49,010 --> 00:38:54,200
Bad is the revolutionary who is afraid of drowning in the rivers of blood!

347
00:38:54,220 --> 00:38:59,140
Long live the Russian revolution!

348
00:39:02,040 --> 00:39:07,020
Long live the cleansing through the blood!

349
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:12,240
Thank you! "Comrade Trotsky, it's amazing."

350
00:39:13,010 --> 00:39:15,230
You have surpassed my wildest expectations.

351
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:20,130
So effectively drop two ballast! -Three. Tell your friends,

352
00:39:20,150 --> 00:39:24,040
from which you take money, that more in their services I do not need.

353
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,220
By the way, you do not need me either.

354
00:39:28,020 --> 00:39:29,120
It's amazing!

355
00:39:43,090 --> 00:39:45,240
"Thank you.

356
00:39:52,010 --> 00:39:54,050
Are we going?

357
00:39:54,230 --> 00:39:57,060
Thank you!

358
00:41:56,130 --> 00:41:58,010
Thank you

359
00:42:09,140 --> 00:42:13,220
-You are an unprincipled bandit. - I'm a revolutionary.

360
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,050
-You were rude to me.

361
00:42:17,100 --> 00:42:20,050
-I taught you to be happy

362
00:42:20,070 --> 00:42:24,150
methods available to me. -That's how you're going to build

363
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,090
your new world? -If you need - yes.

364
00:42:27,110 --> 00:42:31,160
The main thing is that the result should be the same. What does "the same" mean?

365
00:42:31,180 --> 00:42:35,140
-It means that everyone is happy and happy in the end.

366
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,220
-All? -All.

367
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,090
-And are not you taking too much on yourself, comrade revolutionary?

368
00:42:41,110 --> 00:42:44,030
You think you seduced one fragile girl

369
00:42:44,050 --> 00:42:46,200
and now everyone will like it? To all the people?

370
00:42:46,220 --> 00:42:52,170
-And the people are a fragile girl. The masses are their psychology

371
00:42:52,190 --> 00:42:57,150
female. You are by nature passive, waiting for what you offer

372
00:42:57,170 --> 00:43:02,030
man, and then choose the best. So is the people.

373
00:43:02,050 --> 00:43:06,020
Especially - Russian. He is like a student: he never does

374
00:43:06,040 --> 00:43:10,210
the very first step, but it is necessary to appear to a strong confident gentleman,

375
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:14,030
immediately runs with joy to give himself to him.

376
00:43:14,050 --> 00:43:17,090
-I do not understand how you can respond so disparagingly

377
00:43:17,110 --> 00:43:20,160
about the whole people, for whose happiness you, in my opinion, are struggling.

378
00:43:20,180 --> 00:43:24,110
-No neglect. There is a sober assessment of the object

379
00:43:24,130 --> 00:43:27,090
application of forces. -You would see your face now.

380
00:43:27,110 --> 00:43:30,230
On it contempt for this object in large letters

381
00:43:31,000 --> 00:43:34,150
it is written. -And even if so!

382
00:43:34,170 --> 00:43:40,200
The people who have been despotic for centuries are not worthy of contempt?

383
00:43:40,220 --> 00:43:43,180
-And why fight for the happiness of someone you despise?

384
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:47,170
-And then that I'm sick of despising. I want to love.

385
00:43:47,190 --> 00:43:51,200
I want everyone around to be worthy of love. Normal persons

386
00:43:51,220 --> 00:43:56,040
I want to see. Beautiful, happy, joyful - that's how you.

387
00:43:56,060 --> 00:44:01,000
That all around were like that. I want to? But I want to.

388
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:05,160
-What are you doing, buddy ?!

389
00:44:05,180 --> 00:44:09,070
Let's get on with it! We still have a new world to build. Come on!

390
00:44:09,090 --> 00:44:12,170
-General Mamontov broke through the front line at the junction of the 8th and 9th Armies

391
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:15,240
and went to our rear. -How did you break it? What is the number?

392
00:44:16,010 --> 00:44:18,090
Where is he going? Find out - report back.

393
00:44:18,110 --> 00:44:21,210
"Precisely, comrade prerevvoensoveta. Immediately I'll find out.

394
00:44:23,200 --> 00:44:27,130
BIRTHDAY CHILDREN, SWIST, DRINKED VOICES

395
00:44:29,010 --> 00:44:33,010
-So! Harmon to tudy! Smile!

396
00:44:33,190 --> 00:44:37,190
Do not bother! Smile, guys! -What's happening?

397
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:41,140
-Get up! Have risen! Have risen!

398
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:45,090
So here we are - decided to make a photo.

399
00:44:45,110 --> 00:44:49,050
Zhydenko was caught ... a photographer, in the city ...

400
00:44:49,210 --> 00:44:53,110
-Where is it from? -So it's ... we're here oats

401
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:58,220
expropriated for the needs of the army, and in the yard there is this stolen!

402
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,060
Well, do not waste the same good!

403
00:45:04,230 --> 00:45:07,200
- Comrade Pre-Revolutionary Council!

404
00:45:09,230 --> 00:45:13,060
And you can make a photo with you, eh?

405
00:45:14,000 --> 00:45:17,130
Otherwise they will not believe me. To me, Egorka, orphan of Kazan,

406
00:45:17,150 --> 00:45:20,180
barefoot, that I've been ... under your command served.

407
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:25,060
And I told them! - photo. A?

408
00:45:33,210 --> 00:45:36,170
"I want everyone around to be worthy of love.

409
00:45:36,190 --> 00:45:38,130
I want to see normal faces.

410
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:42,030
Beautiful, happy, joyful - that's how you ".

411
00:45:46,180 --> 00:45:49,080
"So you want me to write about this?"

412
00:45:49,130 --> 00:45:52,100
-Well, this is your book, you decide.

413
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:58,220
What do you think, Jackson, why is there propaganda in the world?

414
00:46:00,120 --> 00:46:03,050
- To convey the position of the state to the masses.

415
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:12,100
-To draw illusions that you do not want to lose.

416
00:46:12,120 --> 00:46:16,200
The picture of your world is extremely beautiful.

417
00:46:16,220 --> 00:46:22,180
Somewhere on earth there is a paradise, where the good fair titans rule,

418
00:46:22,200 --> 00:46:27,090
which will protect you from any evil. You so want to believe in it,

419
00:46:27,110 --> 00:46:32,080
that your brain rejects any information that contradicts

420
00:46:32,100 --> 00:46:37,240
this picture. Alas, such a self-suggestion moves more likely

421
00:46:38,010 --> 00:46:41,110
banal craving for comfort, but not facts.

422
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:44,210
-Facts, among other things, and that Lenin is ready to pray

423
00:46:44,230 --> 00:46:47,150
third of the world, and Stalin - his faithful follower.

424
00:46:47,170 --> 00:46:51,110
And it is unlikely that they would have developed this way, whether they really are small people.

425
00:46:51,130 --> 00:46:57,010
-You see, what exact word you have chosen is to pray.

426
00:46:57,030 --> 00:47:00,060
Drop your blinders already, turn your mind on, Frank.

427
00:47:00,080 --> 00:47:06,240
Praying is a religion. That you, as an atheist, must be considered false.

428
00:47:07,010 --> 00:47:11,060
And they did not invent anything new.

429
00:47:11,080 --> 00:47:16,100
Everything was invented before them. Lenin is assigned the role of God the Father,

430
00:47:16,120 --> 00:47:20,240
and Kobe - God the Son. -Yeah. And you - Judah.

431
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:25,110
-Yes. I heard this expression.

432
00:47:26,170 --> 00:47:29,110
Judas Trotsky ...

433
00:47:32,210 --> 00:47:36,110
"Well, judging by your story, it's true."

434
00:47:36,130 --> 00:47:38,210
You betrayed both Lenin and Parvus in one fell swoop.

435
00:47:38,230 --> 00:47:42,160
And if we say Christian analogies, then the role of Judah is right for you

436
00:47:42,180 --> 00:47:45,060
like no other. "What do you think, Jackson,

437
00:47:45,080 --> 00:47:48,200
would Judas become a negative hero if he betrayed, say,

438
00:47:48,220 --> 00:47:50,220
not Jesus, but the high priests?

439
00:47:52,130 --> 00:47:55,220
-And do you think, if the high priests carried out

440
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:59,170
a dream of humanity, to whom would they now pray - on them or on Jesus?

441
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:05,040
-Yes ... For a Stalinist, you have a surprisingly sharp mind.

442
00:48:05,060 --> 00:48:12,040
Till tomorrow, Jackson. By the way, to the note. Neither Lenin nor Parvus

443
00:48:12,060 --> 00:48:17,030
nobody's dreams were realized except his own. Like this.

444
00:49:05,130 --> 00:49:07,150
What do you want from me?

445
00:49:07,170 --> 00:49:14,030
-To me? I have already died a year already. So nothing.

446
00:49:15,170 --> 00:49:17,180
I thought you called me.

447
00:49:19,140 --> 00:49:25,070
-Yesterday another person died because of me,

448
00:49:25,090 --> 00:49:30,100
and I almost did not feel anything. Emptiness inside.

449
00:49:31,160 --> 00:49:38,120
-No ... You did not become either a serial killer or a religious fanatic.

450
00:49:39,230 --> 00:49:42,160
You have become something more terrible.

451
00:49:42,180 --> 00:49:46,140
-You are ... unoriginal.

452
00:49:48,050 --> 00:49:53,010
Since I was kicked out of the Union, I hear it quite often.

453
00:49:53,130 --> 00:49:57,060
-Manyak kills others to feel.

454
00:49:58,030 --> 00:50:02,210
A fanatic kills himself and others to feel.

455
00:50:04,220 --> 00:50:09,190
But you have not felt anything for a long time, Herr the revolutionary.

456
00:50:09,210 --> 00:50:16,110
No love, no pity, no hatred, no compassion for the victims.

457
00:50:16,190 --> 00:50:20,120
-What do you want to hear? Excuses?

458
00:50:20,220 --> 00:50:26,190
- When I looked you in the eye and saw how quickly narrowed

459
00:50:26,210 --> 00:50:31,190
your pupils at the time of stress. This was beautiful.

460
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:37,040
And now ... you know what I see?

461
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:42,240
Nothing. Emptiness in the eyes.

462
00:50:44,210 --> 00:50:47,240
You are indifferent even to the death of others ...

463
00:50:50,090 --> 00:50:52,100
... and his.

464
00:50:53,110 --> 00:50:58,210
-The sense of death is the lot of the weak, Mr. Freud.

465
00:50:59,150 --> 00:51:04,030
I remember you reproached me for my weakness. So, I became strong.

466
00:51:04,050 --> 00:51:07,060
I'm not afraid to die.

467
00:51:08,060 --> 00:51:11,050
-Your indifference to death is quite natural.

468
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,020
Do you know who is absolutely not afraid to die?

469
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:19,130
-Who? -The one who is already ...

470
00:51:24,120 --> 00:51:26,090
... dead.
