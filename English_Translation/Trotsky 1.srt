OVER THE SUBTITLES WORKED: K. FREGER, M.LEVIN, I.KIRIK, E.FIRSOVA

2
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:56,100
- It is everywhere - and in the glow of a fire, And in the dark, unexpected and close,

3
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:03,200
Then on the horse of the Hungarian hussar, And then with a gun Tyrolesky arrow.

4
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:11,020
This is Kolya verse, Gumilev. Do you know what?

5
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,010
-I have no idea. - About death.

6
00:01:17,060 --> 00:01:23,130
They say that God gives each person a life as long as the thread length,

7
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:27,040
wrapped around the human heart.

8
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:30,170
-And I heard that there is no God. -And I said that you

9
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:33,150
chubby gestures? -Larissa, I'm absolutely now

10
00:01:33,170 --> 00:01:37,020
not up to your poetry. Kappel took Simbirsk, from day to day

11
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:41,180
will take Kazan. He sweeps our troops, as if he plays in the towns.

12
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:49,150
- You already killed him? -I told you hundreds of times,

13
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:52,230
my revolutionary struggle takes place in a different way.

14
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:01,020
-Yes, you are a living manifesto. Clothes, gestures, manner of expression.

15
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:04,210
And even your eyes - you know perfectly well how they look good

16
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:11,040
on your tanned face. Only this is not a rally,

17
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,100
this is war. -So what?

18
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,190
-By the bullets do not remember the manifestos.

19
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:27,160
You appeal to reason, but your instincts are stronger.

20
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:35,070
What can be more terrible and stronger than the feelings of impending death?

21
00:02:43,010 --> 00:02:50,140
Where he cries with a cryptic scream, Clocochet, grumbles and screams

22
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:57,080
Unbridled force of darkness, There the canopy of the archangel of the wing,

23
00:02:57,100 --> 00:03:02,070
The road countless essence leads to the ruined Rome.

24
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,090
But if the February Rome falls And goads a harsh shout,

25
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:17,130
Be, merciful angel, to them And stand to them, demon merciless.

26
00:03:45,020 --> 00:03:46,150
SPEAKS IN SPANISH

27
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:13,130
- Leo! We are here!

28
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:18,060
Lyova, have you forgotten to take your pills again? -All is well. Let's go to.

29
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:26,190
A monstrous heat. I just can not get used to it. Good afternoon, Sylvia.

30
00:04:26,210 --> 00:04:31,070
- Hello, Lev Davidovich. -An extremely original

31
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,080
tradition. -A historic Mexican custom.

32
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:38,040
It is believed that on this day they pay homage to the deceased.

33
00:04:39,190 --> 00:04:40,210
Frank!

34
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:44,010
This is my fiance Frank Jackson. I told you about him.

35
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:46,200
-Yes Yes. Very persistent young man.

36
00:04:46,220 --> 00:04:47,240
- Ladies ... -Frank.

37
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:51,090
-Signor Trotsky. - Tell me, Jackson, that you

38
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:54,180
did not understand from our telephone conversation? It seems I clearly

39
00:04:54,200 --> 00:04:58,210
made it clear that there will not be an interview. -Yes, the answer was quite unambiguous.

40
00:04:58,230 --> 00:05:01,040
But I think that I can convince you.

41
00:05:01,060 --> 00:05:04,190
- Convinced? Even my wife does not always get it.

42
00:05:05,110 --> 00:05:11,060
"I would like to thank you, senor Trotsky." Your book saved my life

43
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,220
in Spain. As you can see, this fragment should have belonged to me.

44
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,090
-Why did you bring this book? You are a convinced Stalinist.

45
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:23,140
Or did you think that I would not bring you information about you?

46
00:05:25,200 --> 00:05:28,240
"I really respect Comrade Stalin as an outstanding

47
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:32,220
statist, but that does not mean ... -Your Stalin is a mediocrity

48
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,160
outstanding, worthless.

49
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,090
-Yes, I do not just respect Comrade Stalin, I bow to him.

50
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:44,170
-Aha. -How before the great man,

51
00:05:44,190 --> 00:05:48,110
the ideologist of communism. And you in every little miserable article defame

52
00:05:48,130 --> 00:05:51,220
his name. You call Stalin bloodthirsty for his struggle

53
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,160
with the enemies of the revolution, and they themselves drove millions of people who were

54
00:05:55,180 --> 00:05:58,220
not only were not your ideological opponents,

55
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,190
but did not understand politics at all. -Yes, I really doomed many

56
00:06:02,210 --> 00:06:06,050
to death - and enemies, and their own soldiers. But there is one detail,

57
00:06:06,070 --> 00:06:09,130
which distinguishes me and Koba. -Yes? Which one?

58
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,210
-He absolutely does not care about the idea. He only fosters his human

59
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:19,100
weakness, under the guise of ideology. Paranoia, love of power, greed.

60
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,190
In power, he is the same person that was before her. I had to stop

61
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:30,090
to be oneself, to disappear. Consciously.

62
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:37,010
I did it.

63
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,100
In the name of a great idea.

64
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,010
STUCKING IN THE DOOR. Sign.

65
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,000
It's all? -Voisk retreated to Sviyazhsk,

66
00:07:41,020 --> 00:07:44,050
and, judging by the reports, their condition is extremely deplorable.

67
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:49,070
-The state of the troops is my concern, not yours. You are free, Sermuk.

68
00:07:49,090 --> 00:07:50,170
yes

69
00:07:51,180 --> 00:07:57,020
-I remember well in 1918. We suffered defeat after defeat. Ordinary

70
00:07:57,040 --> 00:08:02,120
measures of influence did not help. The troops did not just retreat - they fled.

71
00:08:03,110 --> 00:08:10,230
-Brats! Here, listen! Come closer! -Well, what are we, Russian people,

72
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,180
against the Russians to go under bullets? -Yes and in general, they say, not for long

73
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:21,030
remained to these Soviets! -Here! Pushcha they themselves, the Bolsheviks,

74
00:08:21,050 --> 00:08:24,110
on Kappel go instead of us! -Yes!

75
00:08:24,130 --> 00:08:28,060
-We admire! -And if the composition is not given,

76
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:33,210
take it for yourself! CROWD: Yes! Yes! Let's take!

77
00:08:34,160 --> 00:08:38,030
- Come home! CROWD: Yes!

78
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:40,110
THE GUYS OF STEAM LOADING

79
00:10:24,130 --> 00:10:32,070
-Soldies! Soldiers of the Red Army! Less than a year has passed

80
00:10:32,090 --> 00:10:37,010
since you and I, holding hands,

81
00:10:37,030 --> 00:10:44,130
threw off the yoke of despotism, class inequality

82
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:50,170
and the exploitation of man by man! But there are those,

83
00:10:50,190 --> 00:10:57,240
who persistently want to make us slaves again.

84
00:10:58,010 --> 00:11:06,010
They are there, on the other side of the front. Landowners, manufacturers,

85
00:11:06,030 --> 00:11:11,160
White Army - they really do not like freedom,

86
00:11:11,180 --> 00:11:18,040
which the Bolsheviks presented to the workers and peasants - you,

87
00:11:18,060 --> 00:11:26,060
all those who had worked three shifts yesterday for three kopecks,

88
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:32,050
and today with a weapon in his hands he says to them: "No, we will not give up

89
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:39,210
you our freedom! No, we will not turn again into your

90
00:11:39,230 --> 00:11:47,030
slaves! "I know each of you is ready to serve the cause

91
00:11:47,050 --> 00:11:53,200
revolution, is ready to lay down his head for her.

92
00:11:56,150 --> 00:11:58,030
Give me your hand, brother.

93
00:11:58,210 --> 00:12:00,110
Give me, bold.

94
00:12:02,130 --> 00:12:09,130
Here! Between me and them there is no difference.

95
00:12:09,150 --> 00:12:13,100
There is nothing that could belong to me and could not

96
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,190
belong to him. Nothing!

97
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:23,220
Take it. Take-take. RIPOT IN THE CROWD

98
00:12:23,240 --> 00:12:26,080
Take it. FROM CROWD: A good gift.

99
00:12:26,140 --> 00:12:29,150
-When did you decide to abandon your pocket watch?

100
00:12:30,140 --> 00:12:33,180
-This is not for me. -I will help.

101
00:12:36,060 --> 00:12:43,090
-World, which we are building, - in this world all the good

102
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:47,230
will be common. Hooray! ALL: Hurray!

103
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:04,070
"But for our victory it is necessary that our enemies are afraid of us."

104
00:13:04,090 --> 00:13:08,100
So that he could not even think back!

105
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:14,220
And how can he not think about it, if we give them a city

106
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:21,210
outside the city, if our soldiers of the revolution were today

107
00:13:21,230 --> 00:13:29,190
panic and fear? Yesterday the soldiers of the 2nd Petrograd Regiment

108
00:13:29,210 --> 00:13:35,120
left their positions on their own and fled.

109
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,030
Where is the commander and commissar of the regiment?

110
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:42,230
- Commander of the 2nd Petrograd Regiment Gneushev.

111
00:13:43,000 --> 00:13:46,090
-Commissar of the 2nd Petrograd Regiment Panteleev.

112
00:13:46,110 --> 00:13:51,050
-Take every tenth soldier out of order.

113
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:57,020
-Tenth.

114
00:14:01,030 --> 00:14:02,110
Tenth.

115
00:14:04,010 --> 00:14:08,240
-Lev Davidovich, these are workers, they recruited Vasilyevsky in printing houses.

116
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:11,140
They saw the rifles for the first time a week ago.

117
00:14:12,080 --> 00:14:13,090
-Tenth.

118
00:14:19,080 --> 00:14:20,110
Tenth.

119
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:28,160
-Do not be afraid. Many contemporaries will not understand you. They will condemn,

120
00:14:28,180 --> 00:14:34,210
even called a Judas. But the future will justify you and exalt you.

121
00:14:37,050 --> 00:14:39,140
Decimation.

122
00:14:40,210 --> 00:14:42,080
-Tenth.

123
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:47,040
-Now, stand in the line.

124
00:14:50,200 --> 00:14:54,120
Comrade Commissar, you, too, get on the job.

125
00:14:58,200 --> 00:15:06,160
For the shameful betrayal of Soviet Russia, the revolutionary tribunal sentences

126
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:11,110
deserters of the 2 nd Petrograd Regiment ...

127
00:15:11,130 --> 00:15:14,240
-That's it! -... their commander Gneushev

128
00:15:15,010 --> 00:15:22,050
and Commissioner Panteleyev sentence to the highest penalty - shooting.

129
00:15:24,060 --> 00:15:26,080
The sentence is to be carried out.

130
00:15:38,180 --> 00:15:42,140
Perhaps now my actions seem too cruel to you,

131
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,090
but then I sought from the troops not just discipline - I sought,

132
00:15:46,110 --> 00:15:50,200
if you will, the greatest manifestation of love. Yes, yes, you did not misinterpret -

133
00:15:50,220 --> 00:15:55,100
love. The enemy was a force that was born only by death. I became that force,

134
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,010
which could execute, but could also be pardoned.

135
00:16:00,030 --> 00:16:04,090
"You mean you wanted to become a second God for the soldiers?"

136
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:08,230
-The second one? No, Jackson, no. Look wider. I had to

137
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:13,240
oust him. God is a convention, nobody saw him. I stood with these

138
00:16:14,010 --> 00:16:18,090
people on the same land, it was easier to believe in me.

139
00:16:18,110 --> 00:16:21,070
And they believed. -Well, if they turned their

140
00:16:21,090 --> 00:16:26,050
bayonets against you? -Yes, such an opportunity existed.

141
00:16:27,090 --> 00:16:31,120
However, the soldiers acted differently - they raised the enemy's bayonets.

142
00:16:32,060 --> 00:16:35,070
-I do not understand. -I also did not understand it before,

143
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:40,040
until he met a man who explained this science to me.

144
00:17:10,030 --> 00:17:11,080
Beast!

145
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:33,070
We demand Trotsky! SCANDED "TROTSKY"

146
00:17:39,040 --> 00:17:41,170
-Humble! Be silent!

147
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:43,150
SCANDED "TROTSKY"

148
00:17:44,020 --> 00:17:45,180
Be silent! Be silent to all!

149
00:17:46,210 --> 00:17:48,070
SCANDED "TROTSKY"

150
00:17:48,090 --> 00:17:52,130
Demidov! Run after Nikolai! What are you standing there for Trotsky?

151
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:54,190
Be silent! Be silent to all!

152
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:06,170
-All like the chain broke, the rogues. And most importantly, everything is as harmonious as a sentry

153
00:18:06,190 --> 00:18:09,110
mechanism. "You're calmer, Demidov,

154
00:18:09,130 --> 00:18:12,240
quieter. Who, you say, is there water troubling?

155
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:16,060
-Zhidok from the 17th chamber, Bronstein. -Political?

156
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:17,200
"Yes.

157
00:18:20,190 --> 00:18:22,240
SCANDED "TROTSKY"

158
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,050
Open it.

159
00:18:55,170 --> 00:18:57,050
What's making noise?

160
00:18:58,130 --> 00:19:02,060
-We demand to immediately stop the practice of beating prisoners

161
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,170
overseers. We demand the provision of emergency medical care

162
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:11,110
our friend, Sivoronov. We demand to punish the guilty.

163
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,120
Besides ... -You ...

164
00:19:15,100 --> 00:19:19,050
-... in the context of our requirements it does not matter.

165
00:19:19,070 --> 00:19:23,180
-... You probably play chess. -In the context of our requirements ...

166
00:19:23,200 --> 00:19:27,190
-Make a favor, do not refuse, one batch.

167
00:19:42,060 --> 00:19:46,210
Around all mediocrity, there is no one to even train with

168
00:19:46,230 --> 00:19:49,040
logical thinking, do not believe it.

169
00:19:51,170 --> 00:19:52,220
-In the right.

170
00:19:57,230 --> 00:19:59,020
Please, sit.

171
00:20:00,150 --> 00:20:05,090
But you, Bronstein, are a phenomenon. By God, darling, a phenomenon.

172
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,100
For 27 years in Russian prisons I do not recall the case,

173
00:20:10,120 --> 00:20:16,070
so that the Jewish brat could lead to the rebellion of the Russian matriarchs.

174
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:21,020
And you know, for what atrocities arrested Sivoronov, whom you

175
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:24,000
Were they defending? -And me, Mr. Trotsky ...

176
00:20:26,100 --> 00:20:29,000
is not at all interested in what he was arrested for.

177
00:20:29,020 --> 00:20:34,170
For whatsoever, he is still a man, has rights, and you oppress him.

178
00:20:34,190 --> 00:20:39,020
And all the oppressed seek freedom and justice.

179
00:20:39,040 --> 00:20:44,000
-You, the right word, you, Jews and revolutionaries, do not know

180
00:20:44,020 --> 00:20:48,020
Russian people, but all the while trying to get it from someone

181
00:20:48,040 --> 00:20:53,220
save and release. Russian people can not be liberated, otherwise inside

182
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:59,190
his soul will rise up such a darkness that will devour the whole world,

183
00:20:59,210 --> 00:21:04,040
and the first - liberators. The Russian people can only be governed,

184
00:21:04,060 --> 00:21:09,060
for his own good. -Even if it is so,

185
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,160
why beat? To beat a man who is already caught,

186
00:21:13,180 --> 00:21:18,020
awaits trial with legal punishment? -And how else can people be managed?

187
00:21:18,040 --> 00:21:24,020
-How? By personal example, leading to the ideals of justice.

188
00:21:26,210 --> 00:21:28,040
-Are you blissful?

189
00:21:31,020 --> 00:21:36,070
Yes, if it pierces you, with your kindness, to live for at least 5 more years,

190
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:40,060
you certainly will understand that you can only manage people ...

191
00:21:41,180 --> 00:21:43,020
fear.

192
00:21:46,180 --> 00:21:51,000
Fear is at the core of any order.

193
00:21:52,110 --> 00:21:57,100
Better to beat one undeservedly, in front of everyone, rather than later

194
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,070
beat anyone who loses fear and chaos.

195
00:22:01,170 --> 00:22:05,230
- Do not you think it's inhuman?

196
00:22:06,110 --> 00:22:10,120
-Of course. I am in power.

197
00:22:11,230 --> 00:22:16,150
It is impossible to decide the fate of people, remaining for them a man.

198
00:22:16,170 --> 00:22:21,170
It is only now, by youth, you naively believe that the world

199
00:22:21,190 --> 00:22:25,240
ready to follow you only out of sympathy with your utopian

200
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:32,070
dreams. But two years later the naive will pass,

201
00:22:32,090 --> 00:22:40,090
and the thirst for power will remain. That's what I see in your eyes, Bronstein.

202
00:22:49,170 --> 00:22:54,080
"Your words are beautiful, Mr. Trotsky, but they are refuted by all those,

203
00:22:54,100 --> 00:22:59,040
that now occurs. And because of your chauvinistic nature

204
00:22:59,060 --> 00:23:04,000
narrow-mindedness can not see it. Well, you beat Sivoronov,

205
00:23:04,020 --> 00:23:08,000
to frighten others. So what? The opposite was achieved.

206
00:23:08,020 --> 00:23:12,020
People have united and demand justice.

207
00:23:13,030 --> 00:23:17,150
"So they do not demand more, do you hear?" -Prefer more, be still.

208
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:21,240
Do not be surprised then, when a wave of popular anger will sweep you away

209
00:23:22,010 --> 00:23:25,230
and throw it where you belong and in the cesspool of history.

210
00:23:29,020 --> 00:23:30,170
-Well, but how else?

211
00:23:32,010 --> 00:23:34,070
Caesar, as they say, Caesar's.

212
00:23:38,160 --> 00:23:41,230
And to us, the dogs are rotten ...

213
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:47,120
only to howl and ask for a bone.

214
00:23:49,060 --> 00:23:57,050
Fate-with. In the 21st century, with the general roar of the jubilant crowd,

215
00:23:57,070 --> 00:24:03,060
blouse, snout with a shoe knife in his hand, climb the stairs

216
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:05,230
to the wonderful face of the Sistine Madonna ...

217
00:24:07,150 --> 00:24:13,090
and will undress this face in the name of universal equality and brotherhood.

218
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:18,130
You so-so imagine it? -No, you are so-so imagine

219
00:24:18,150 --> 00:24:23,090
21st century. This is your, gendarme, worldview, which is capable of

220
00:24:23,110 --> 00:24:27,240
only to distort the best. To all - in robes. Breathing and coughing

221
00:24:28,010 --> 00:24:31,130
on command, to live by order - this is what you imagine.

222
00:24:31,180 --> 00:24:37,120
-Yes about the 21st century - it's not me. This is Dostoevsky.

223
00:24:38,030 --> 00:24:40,070
Are you also in a cesspool? ..

224
00:24:42,030 --> 00:24:46,060
Yes, Mr. Bronstein ...

225
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:53,220
I was wrong in you. I thought that you have something real. But no, solid

226
00:24:53,240 --> 00:24:56,120
oratory and posturing. Mat.

227
00:25:01,170 --> 00:25:03,240
In his house!

228
00:25:07,150 --> 00:25:09,010
GROM, NOISE RAIN

229
00:25:17,040 --> 00:25:18,130
BELL BELL

230
00:25:40,030 --> 00:25:44,170
- I am nobody and dissolved ...

231
00:25:46,050 --> 00:25:48,160
In the square of light near the heavens ...

232
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:53,010
I died not condemned ...

233
00:25:54,190 --> 00:25:56,240
And again he was resurrected.

234
00:25:58,020 --> 00:26:00,200
And day is like night, and night is like eternity ...

235
00:26:01,230 --> 00:26:04,000
And only faith in humanity

236
00:26:04,200 --> 00:26:07,070
I'm not allowed to go insane.

237
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:13,030
-You can only manage people with fear.

238
00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:17,100
SCANDED "TROTSKY"

239
00:26:20,030 --> 00:26:24,090
-A day is like night, and night is like eternity ...

240
00:26:25,010 --> 00:26:27,090
And only faith in humanity

241
00:26:27,110 --> 00:26:29,240
I'm not allowed to go insane.

242
00:26:44,070 --> 00:26:45,230
Dad!

243
00:26:47,180 --> 00:26:49,000
Dad!

244
00:26:50,020 --> 00:26:52,060
Do not leave me!

245
00:26:53,120 --> 00:26:55,000
Don't leave I beg you to come down

246
00:26:57,040 --> 00:26:58,170
Dad!

247
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:01,040
- Leiba!

248
00:27:02,060 --> 00:27:04,010
SEVERE BREATH

249
00:27:11,110 --> 00:27:14,170
-Father? It's you?

250
00:27:15,150 --> 00:27:18,180
- I, who else.

251
00:27:20,160 --> 00:27:24,020
Well, Bronstein, is the lesson learned?

252
00:27:26,110 --> 00:27:27,210
-Based.

253
00:27:30,020 --> 00:27:34,090
I swear, I'll get out of here ...

254
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:41,200
and destroy all your foul world.

255
00:27:42,180 --> 00:27:47,070
- Nothing will come of it. Because the scruffy world is in you.

256
00:27:50,020 --> 00:27:52,080
Remember, Leiba.

257
00:27:53,220 --> 00:28:00,040
I tell you this, Nikolai Trotsky, who can crush you

258
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,160
Right. Now!}

259
00:28:19,200 --> 00:28:22,040
- Walk to the stove, warm up. -Thank you.

260
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:28,010
-Now, and the frost is now. Maybe you can fix the clothes better,

261
00:28:28,030 --> 00:28:32,080
and then on the road, you will throw off the hooves. -Nothing, I'm used to it. What about the documents?

262
00:28:33,050 --> 00:28:36,150
-Documents can be done efficiently, not a single bastard will be undermined.

263
00:28:36,170 --> 00:28:42,160
You, the main thing, tell me which name to enter. Petrov or Stepanov?

264
00:28:43,190 --> 00:28:48,110
"It is impossible to decide the fate of people, remaining for them a man."

265
00:28:48,210 --> 00:28:51,130
-Trotsky. "It's me telling you,

266
00:28:51,150 --> 00:28:54,140
Nikolai Trotsky. "My name is Trotsky.

267
00:29:10,150 --> 00:29:13,060
"So you took the name of your jailer?"

268
00:29:13,080 --> 00:29:15,040
- I did not just take it.

269
00:29:17,050 --> 00:29:21,100
I ... immortalized her.

270
00:29:24,020 --> 00:29:27,180
I, if you will, took off his skin and put it on,

271
00:29:27,200 --> 00:29:33,210
as some hunters do. And, in fact, who is a hunter?

272
00:29:34,180 --> 00:29:40,070
This monster, overpowered by another monster, no more.

273
00:29:42,150 --> 00:29:47,220
In 1918 I was obliged to become the most terrible of monsters.

274
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:51,100
And he became it. -Then it justifies all that,

275
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:53,240
to which Comrade Stalin is compelled to go today.

276
00:29:54,200 --> 00:30:00,000
-The monsters are divided into two categories. Some become them

277
00:30:00,020 --> 00:30:03,240
for the sake of a super-goal, and others - simply because they like.

278
00:30:04,010 --> 00:30:08,030
-Do you know what I just heard? Allegation

279
00:30:08,050 --> 00:30:11,170
wounded lion, harboring resentment against a stronger opponent.

280
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:15,200
And yet it's Stalin, not you, he built a world that everyone dreamed of.

281
00:30:16,020 --> 00:30:18,080
He did it, but you do not.

282
00:30:19,040 --> 00:30:23,120
"My dear, it's time to drink the medicine." -Natasha, I do not want to. Today I am myself

283
00:30:23,140 --> 00:30:26,200
I feel great. - Do not argue, please.

284
00:30:26,220 --> 00:30:30,170
You know, it's useless. -You see, Jackson, not only

285
00:30:30,190 --> 00:30:34,050
you do not recognize my leadership.

286
00:30:42,040 --> 00:30:46,050
"I think your wife sees you as an ordinary person,

287
00:30:46,070 --> 00:30:49,020
who needs to sleep, eat and drink medicine.

288
00:30:49,040 --> 00:30:51,110
-You think so, Jackson.

289
00:30:53,110 --> 00:31:00,030
I am sure that for her I am much more than an ordinary person.

290
00:31:09,130 --> 00:31:15,160
While in Europe they talk, Russia demands real deeds. I drove through

291
00:31:15,180 --> 00:31:21,060
in freight wagons 8000 miles to get here to you, to Europe,

292
00:31:21,080 --> 00:31:23,210
a forge of revolutionary thought. And what do I see?

293
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:30,030
Revolutionary thought through and through smelt of apple strudel.

294
00:31:30,200 --> 00:31:34,020
The newspaper Iskra writes the same thing all year round, the same thing!

295
00:31:34,040 --> 00:31:38,230
How much can you dream of a helpless theory of revolution in a well-fed Europe?

296
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:48,220
You look like a gymnast, summoning the spirit of revolution to the saints.

297
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,140
And you believe that he will come! -Neslyanno!

298
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:54,050
"Comrade says the same thing. -Said it right!

299
00:31:54,070 --> 00:31:58,090
-But not in Europe, but in Russia now the most striking contrast

300
00:31:58,110 --> 00:32:01,130
Between the wealth of the rich and the poverty of the poor.

301
00:32:01,190 --> 00:32:06,150
Throughout the country millions of brutalized disgruntled people,

302
00:32:06,170 --> 00:32:10,160
and right now Russia needs a revolution,

303
00:32:10,180 --> 00:32:14,220
otherwise the authorities will again start another war with Europe and write off on it

304
00:32:14,240 --> 00:32:17,160
all troubles. -What he's carrying! Revolution is possible

305
00:32:17,180 --> 00:32:20,200
only in an industrially developed country, only in Europe.

306
00:32:20,220 --> 00:32:26,060
-Nonsense! Europe, in which live the well-fed, calm people,

307
00:32:26,080 --> 00:32:30,020
can not lead - therefore, it always

308
00:32:30,040 --> 00:32:33,070
will be driven. -Russia is a backward country.

309
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:36,060
-Yes, backward.

310
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:43,190
Zakostenelaya, spinning, burning in its own malice,

311
00:32:43,210 --> 00:32:49,240
but this is power. This is an energy comparable to ocean energy

312
00:32:50,010 --> 00:32:55,160
tides. I say to you: take this power,

313
00:32:55,180 --> 00:33:00,070
tame, arm, and she will sweep away everything in its path.

314
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:01,200
"Bravo"

315
00:33:01,220 --> 00:33:06,030
I have not been so cheerful for a long time. Your naivety may outweigh

316
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:10,030
only your stupidity. Farewell, child in a kosovorotke!

317
00:33:10,050 --> 00:33:15,100
"It's only good, Comrade Plekhanov." You obviously stayed long in this cafe.

318
00:33:22,110 --> 00:33:25,030
"Comrade Trotsky, allow me to introduce myself ..."

319
00:33:38,040 --> 00:33:41,090
-I totally agree with you. Left to myself

320
00:33:41,110 --> 00:33:44,170
The proletariat will limit itself to economic demands.

321
00:33:44,190 --> 00:33:48,060
People between freedom and bread will always choose bread.

322
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:49,200
Please...

323
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:53,120
Lenin. - I know who you are.

324
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:56,220
If you really think so, why did not you support me?

325
00:33:56,240 --> 00:33:59,020
- He has authority in the party.

326
00:33:59,040 --> 00:34:03,060
Our quarrel will hurt the movement. And you with such outbursts

327
00:34:03,080 --> 00:34:06,240
quickly burn out. "Is it better to smolder than you?"

328
00:34:07,010 --> 00:34:09,100
I'm afraid I will not be forgiven. -Who?

329
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:11,180
-People. -Do you worry about the people?

330
00:34:11,200 --> 00:34:13,150
-And you-about whom?

331
00:34:15,130 --> 00:34:17,090
-I want to change the world.

332
00:34:18,040 --> 00:34:21,070
What do people have to do with it? People are just a tool.

333
00:34:21,090 --> 00:34:23,180
-In your hands. -And in yours.

334
00:34:23,200 --> 00:34:28,160
And our task is to make them want a revolution, not bread.

335
00:34:28,180 --> 00:34:32,080
-Well, and how to do this, if you constantly agree with Plekhanov?

336
00:34:33,020 --> 00:34:36,200
-Georgy Valentinovich is also just a man.

337
00:34:37,130 --> 00:34:41,000
-Is there an instrument? - Quickly learn.

338
00:34:41,020 --> 00:34:43,060
And come to visit.

339
00:34:43,120 --> 00:34:48,140
In a simple way, without ranks, in a friendly manner. -We are not friends with you.

340
00:34:48,160 --> 00:34:50,110
Well?

341
00:34:52,160 --> 00:34:54,070
bread is broken.

342
00:35:13,240 --> 00:35:15,150
STOCK IN THE DOOR

343
00:35:16,010 --> 00:35:17,130
"Yes."

344
00:35:20,140 --> 00:35:22,220
-Good afternoon! Let me introduce myself,

345
00:35:22,240 --> 00:35:26,200
Parvus Alexander Lvovich. -I know who you are.

346
00:35:27,180 --> 00:35:31,020
-And what do you know about me? -You are the person who makes money

347
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:36,130
on everything, even on the revolution. In a word, an extremely slippery type.

348
00:35:37,180 --> 00:35:42,090
-I came to congratulate you on one brilliant, but, unfortunately,

349
00:35:42,110 --> 00:35:46,020
nothing changing speech. You are a wonderful speaker,

350
00:35:46,040 --> 00:35:49,120
a great publicist, you are a man who, undoubtedly,

351
00:35:49,140 --> 00:35:52,220
there are makings of a leader. So I came to offer you help.

352
00:35:52,240 --> 00:35:54,120
-Thank you, I do not need.

353
00:35:55,210 --> 00:35:59,190
-Do you think it's better to sit here?

354
00:36:00,130 --> 00:36:04,220
Let's talk frankly. Plekhanov and Lenin are great people,

355
00:36:04,240 --> 00:36:06,230
long leading the movement.

356
00:36:07,000 --> 00:36:09,040
But, unfortunately, nothing happens.

357
00:36:09,060 --> 00:36:11,240
-What are you driving at? -Direction needs a new leader.

358
00:36:12,010 --> 00:36:16,200
And there is such a leader. A man who will light hearts, for which people will go

359
00:36:16,220 --> 00:36:19,160
not only in coffee shops, but, if necessary, and with bayonets.

360
00:36:19,180 --> 00:36:23,030
Such a leader is you, Lev. - No one knows me.

361
00:36:23,050 --> 00:36:26,040
-Nonsense. Making people famous is my job.

362
00:36:26,060 --> 00:36:30,060
I made Maxim Gorky. Now he is known throughout Europe.

363
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:33,180
-Gorky is a writer. I do not need such glory.

364
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,080
-Even as needed! Let's talk like this: let's say an actress -

365
00:36:38,100 --> 00:36:42,130
if it is not known, it is of no use to anyone or interesting,

366
00:36:42,150 --> 00:36:46,100
But as soon as she becomes a prima, everything is ready to be thrown at her feet:

367
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:49,160
money, jewels, if necessary, kingdoms ...

368
00:36:49,180 --> 00:36:53,000
Yes, there were such precedents.

369
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:56,150
The revolutionary leader - as a prima, must come out and immediately take

370
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:59,190
viewers, supervise them. It's kind of ...

371
00:37:02,040 --> 00:37:06,010
sex. No, this is sex itself.

372
00:37:07,150 --> 00:37:11,000
-Well, I agree. And what is your interest?

373
00:37:12,110 --> 00:37:17,000
-Money. I will make you the most influential revolutionary

374
00:37:17,020 --> 00:37:19,220
modernity, I will earn money on your behalf.

375
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:23,070
As you can see, I do not hide anything. I do not build myself a monk,

376
00:37:23,090 --> 00:37:26,060
I'm a merchant.

377
00:37:30,170 --> 00:37:33,100
-I agree. Where do we start?

378
00:37:38,170 --> 00:37:40,080
-Milayshy!

379
00:37:46,090 --> 00:37:49,230
Courage! Courage, my friend! This house belongs to me. I'm sitting here

380
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:52,150
your colleagues, socialists. Please, I beg!

381
00:37:55,050 --> 00:37:58,200
Of course, it's not the Metropol, and certainly not the Hilton, but still a house,

382
00:37:58,220 --> 00:38:01,120
what-no, and housing. -Alexander Lvovich!

383
00:38:02,150 --> 00:38:04,080
How good that I met you!

384
00:38:04,100 --> 00:38:06,200
I would like to pay a fee for the next month.

385
00:38:06,220 --> 00:38:10,100
-Natalya Ivanovna, how many times have I said that I will not accept money from you.

386
00:38:10,120 --> 00:38:13,000
Uvolte-dismiss. -And I've told you many times,

387
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:16,100
that you can settle here for free these socialists,

388
00:38:16,120 --> 00:38:20,030
and I do not intend to be a prizhivalko. Take it, or I'll eat it!

389
00:38:21,030 --> 00:38:23,000
-As you wish.

390
00:38:24,100 --> 00:38:26,210
Meet your new neighbor. Leon Trotsky.

391
00:38:26,230 --> 00:38:28,060
Hello

392
00:38:29,090 --> 00:38:31,190
- I was at one of your shows.

393
00:38:32,190 --> 00:38:36,080
-Yeah. Well, how about you? -I did not like.

394
00:38:36,190 --> 00:38:38,080
Nice to meet.

395
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:47,210
-I would be glad to hope something of you, but, alas, a hard nut to crack.

396
00:38:47,230 --> 00:38:49,080
Oh, please! I beg!

397
00:38:50,090 --> 00:38:53,090
The door can always be locked with a key.

398
00:38:55,190 --> 00:38:58,020
From the ceiling does not flow.

399
00:39:00,010 --> 00:39:02,110
Well? How are you?

400
00:39:08,230 --> 00:39:13,120
- Quite, quite ... In any case, not a cellar.

401
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:16,060
-You are right, not a cellar.

402
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:18,180
-And how, you say, call this girl?

403
00:39:21,160 --> 00:39:25,130
Well, you're not the first, you're not the last ... Natalia Sedova.

404
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:31,000
She is a man from a completely different society, Leo. Bohemia.

405
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:36,110
Theaters, exhibitions ... Other life, other ideals.

406
00:39:39,070 --> 00:39:40,230
-I understood you.

407
00:39:41,170 --> 00:39:43,110
-Good luck.

408
00:39:49,070 --> 00:39:53,050
Plekhanov is a significant figure, but he is old. Put on it -

409
00:39:53,070 --> 00:39:57,100
at least, unreasonable. I would bet on Lenin.

410
00:39:58,070 --> 00:40:01,150
He is less clean in the choice of means.

411
00:40:02,090 --> 00:40:05,190
-Lenin is too stubborn and obsessed with personal revenge,

412
00:40:05,210 --> 00:40:10,000
and this can interfere with the main goal. There is another option.

413
00:40:10,020 --> 00:40:15,010
-Yes? As far as I'm aware, in the Russian revolutionary movement

414
00:40:15,030 --> 00:40:18,120
There are no more figures of the level of Plekhanov and Lenin.

415
00:40:18,140 --> 00:40:23,160
-No. This newcomer is rapidly gaining credibility

416
00:40:23,180 --> 00:40:28,130
in a revolutionary environment. If you invest in his upbringing ...

417
00:40:28,150 --> 00:40:33,050
-We have little time. I do not know when the war will begin, but it will begin.

418
00:40:33,070 --> 00:40:37,140
In the courtyard of the twentieth century, one cannon can not be defeated now.

419
00:40:37,160 --> 00:40:41,190
We need a real lever to destabilize Russia.

420
00:40:44,040 --> 00:40:45,200
Audi A6

421
00:40:47,150 --> 00:40:53,180
On the other hand ... if we grow Trotsky from this

422
00:40:53,200 --> 00:40:57,160
pocket revolutionist - an entertaining idea!

423
00:40:58,100 --> 00:41:02,090
How much do you think you need money to ruin Russia?

424
00:41:02,110 --> 00:41:04,240
through the revolution?

425
00:41:07,130 --> 00:41:10,190
-It is always very difficult to answer this question.

426
00:41:12,010 --> 00:41:14,110
I think that...

427
00:41:16,150 --> 00:41:19,000
a billion marks will be enough.

428
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:29,080
"I have long wanted to ask you, Gelfand,

429
00:41:29,100 --> 00:41:33,010
why did you choose the pseudonym Alexander Parvus?

430
00:41:33,210 --> 00:41:36,070
Shy of your Jewishness?

431
00:41:37,120 --> 00:41:40,110
-Good luck. -Bye.

432
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:46,120
-The more perfect the appearance of a person, the more demons

433
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:52,200
he has inside. And people, looking at the beautiful (wait),

434
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,220
want to see the hidden, low-lying, it attracts.

435
00:41:56,240 --> 00:42:00,000
Not bad, not bad. -I think we risk losing ourselves

436
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:03,120
for all this tinsel. -In politics, nothing is accidental,

437
00:42:03,140 --> 00:42:07,110
everything is important: what you say, how you say, how you look ...

438
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:11,050
Everything should be a single whole ... manifesto.

439
00:42:12,130 --> 00:42:17,100
Remember about Natalie? -Emansip that did not like

440
00:42:17,120 --> 00:42:19,110
my speech? -No, no, it's not that,

441
00:42:19,130 --> 00:42:24,100
that you spoke badly. The thing is ... how can I tell you ...

442
00:42:24,120 --> 00:42:28,030
all the Social Democrats look ugly,

443
00:42:28,050 --> 00:42:32,080
Bad clothes. I understand, the most important thing is your inner world,

444
00:42:32,100 --> 00:42:36,130
this is the most valuable. But internal aesthetics, not flavored by external

445
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,130
kind, like only the marginals.

446
00:42:41,050 --> 00:42:44,090
Yes, I have good news for you.

447
00:42:44,110 --> 00:42:48,100
A letter from some lady Sokolovskaya.

448
00:42:49,160 --> 00:42:53,040
You seem to be married, you have two children ...

449
00:42:56,020 --> 00:42:58,030
Do not you regret it?

450
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:02,120
-I never regret anything.

451
00:43:08,060 --> 00:43:12,030
- "Hello, dear Lyova." For six months now, how are we managed in exile

452
00:43:12,050 --> 00:43:17,020
without you. Glad you reached Europe safely. I always believed,

453
00:43:17,040 --> 00:43:22,060
that at you it will turn out. Our girls grew up. Zina remembers you,

454
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:27,000
asks when the pope arrives. Nina, it seems, has finally stopped

455
00:43:27,020 --> 00:43:31,120
to be ill. I do not know what else to add. I constantly remember our

456
00:43:31,140 --> 00:43:33,170
last day".

457
00:43:37,020 --> 00:43:38,060
-Whoa! - Hello!

458
00:43:38,230 --> 00:43:41,010
-This is for you, documents.

459
00:43:41,030 --> 00:43:43,140
Hide it ... Trotsky.

460
00:43:50,110 --> 00:43:52,060
-How's Nina? -Sleep.

461
00:43:54,200 --> 00:43:56,080
When?

462
00:43:58,240 --> 00:44:03,220
-Today. Otherwise, it will not escape the taiga, it will.

463
00:44:05,010 --> 00:44:07,110
"But it's not forever, is it?"

464
00:44:10,230 --> 00:44:16,070
You will leave, but then we ... Will we be together?

465
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,030
-Yes. Oh sure.

466
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:29,010
-Well, get up! -A! A!

467
00:44:29,030 --> 00:44:31,170
-Why lie down? IMPACT

468
00:44:31,190 --> 00:44:34,000
Stand up, I said!

469
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:48,170
-Too late. I hope, answered all your questions?

470
00:44:50,170 --> 00:44:52,000
Thank you.

471
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,150
-Here, Jackson ...

472
00:44:59,230 --> 00:45:02,200
If you decide to continue ...

473
00:45:06,010 --> 00:45:11,020
Come. From this day you are happy in this house.

474
00:46:19,130 --> 00:46:24,130
-You will leave, but then we ... Will we be together?

475
00:46:30,030 --> 00:46:31,120
I: Yes, of course.

476
00:46:44,030 --> 00:46:50,090
-Sorry, Levushka? -Sorry ... Sasha.

477
00:47:07,220 --> 00:47:13,000
-Dad! We're here, Dad! - Dad, do not leave me!

478
00:47:13,190 --> 00:47:16,100
Dad! Dad!

479
00:47:47,120 --> 00:47:50,050
- Leo ... are you alive?
