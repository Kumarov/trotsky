SUBTITLES: K. FREGER, M. LEVIN, E. MASLENNIKOVA, Y. KARAVAN,

S. HOTYOV, L. NIESERENKO

3
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:27,090
-What the heck?!

4
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:29,200
What do you want?

5
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:37,240
You saw me pathetic, and I was the chairman of the Revolutionary Military

6
00:00:38,010 --> 00:00:42,180
advice! A sacred deity! Demon!

7
00:01:01,040 --> 00:01:02,110
- Your keys.

8
00:01:05,050 --> 00:01:06,050
Thank you

9
00:01:06,130 --> 00:01:12,010
Nice to meet you. -Wait. A...

10
00:01:13,140 --> 00:01:18,210
What was it? -Your age it's time to know

11
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:22,110
such things. -What? No, hell! I'm talking about something else.

12
00:01:25,090 --> 00:01:28,080
I saw him in the window, he was talking to himself.

13
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:30,230
Does he have hallucinations? Is he going crazy?

14
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:36,150
-Such as Leon do not go crazy.

15
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:44,040
They know how to see what we do not see, ordinary people.

16
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,170
And you know what? Today for a moment it seemed to me that I too ...

17
00:01:51,220 --> 00:01:53,150
just about to see.

18
00:02:32,110 --> 00:02:35,080
-So that's why you were not. This is not an accident.

19
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,010
- Hello, Jackson. What do you mean?

20
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:44,220
- You called Frieda, did not you? They told her to invite him to leave.

21
00:02:44,240 --> 00:02:50,060
And they left to prevent them from interfering. He does not listen to you, but can listen

22
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:52,070
young mistress.

23
00:02:54,090 --> 00:02:58,060
- Tell him - I'll destroy you.

24
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,040
-Now I understand why he loved you.

25
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:15,090
-In connection with the current situation of dual power Petrosoviet

26
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:19,110
does not consider it possible to support any initiatives

27
00:03:19,130 --> 00:03:26,060
Provisional Government. All workers, soldiers and sailors

28
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:32,060
organizations are strictly enjoined: to sabotage any

29
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:38,000
orders of the Provisional Government and personally Kerensky A.F.

30
00:03:39,230 --> 00:03:42,210
Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet Trotsky.

31
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:46,170
-Tell me, Lev Davidovich,

32
00:03:46,190 --> 00:03:49,140
and the chairman of the Petrograd Soviet Trotsky

33
00:03:49,160 --> 00:03:54,220
ever learn a typewriter? "Natasha, you know,

34
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:57,210
I and technology are incompatible things.

35
00:03:58,220 --> 00:04:02,180
CALL TO THE DOOR Are we waiting for someone?

36
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:19,050
Zina, Nina! My girls! Oh, how straight you became girls!

37
00:04:19,070 --> 00:04:21,160
Natasha, look who's here!

38
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,020
-Hello. -Leva, Seryozha, meet the sisters!

39
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:28,080
Hello my darling!

40
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:37,170
-Sasha, hello, my friend. -Hi.

41
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,040
-Let me help you. -What is your name? Lyova?

42
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:43,240
-Sereza. - Are you Seryozha?

43
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:46,180
- Let's show you the rooms! There.

44
00:04:51,030 --> 00:04:52,140
Hello my dear!

45
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:01,140
- So, you will live with my mother, yes? -Yes. It's not far from here,

46
00:05:01,160 --> 00:05:03,150
in two blocks of everything. -Yeah.

47
00:05:04,140 --> 00:05:06,170
-Now, we'll see each other every day.

48
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,010
-Well, what about grandfather? I certainly did not want to let you go to Petrograd.

49
00:05:17,030 --> 00:05:22,040
-Of course! Threatened us to lock. But we still insisted.

50
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:26,120
Zinka did this to him! -Of course. Here the revolution,

51
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:32,010
here life is boiling. And there alone sheep and goats and flour grind

52
00:05:32,030 --> 00:05:35,220
from morning to evening. -Them more ... Mom from the link

53
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:39,050
released. So my grandfather did not have a chance.

54
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:44,110
Family reunification. -I am my grandfather never in my life

55
00:05:44,130 --> 00:05:46,160
did not see...

56
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:59,140
- Do you want me to drive you tomorrow by car?

57
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,030
Do you have a car?

58
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,170
-Machine is not mine-official. But I could after the speech

59
00:06:07,190 --> 00:06:11,070
arrange a tour of the city. And then we'll go and watch,

60
00:06:11,090 --> 00:06:15,050
how to build bridges. Is it good? -Of course!

61
00:06:15,070 --> 00:06:19,110
-Will we see the Winter Palace? -A winter, and Taurian.

62
00:06:19,130 --> 00:06:24,080
And even Peterhof. Dress warmer. It's a pity that the fountains do not work.

63
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:29,200
- Stop talking, the cake is ready. - Here's the cake. Eat.

64
00:06:30,030 --> 00:06:31,170
I'll go and work.

65
00:06:39,220 --> 00:06:43,020
-Leva, Seryozha, the girls!

66
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,070
CHEERFUL CHILD'S LAUGHTER

67
00:07:20,100 --> 00:07:21,120
SHOOTING

68
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,070
- Good morning, Frank. And your door was open.

69
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:55,070
-I need to wash.

70
00:08:20,140 --> 00:08:22,190
And you are an interesting woman, Frida.

71
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:26,180
This is your free love ...

72
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:30,000
your pictures ...

73
00:08:32,190 --> 00:08:34,130
primitivism, shocking ...

74
00:08:36,130 --> 00:08:38,150
fixation on the theme of death ...

75
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:45,040
But most of all I'm not interested in knowing what?

76
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:51,200
Why are you here. -Do you know that Leon has become attached?

77
00:08:51,220 --> 00:08:56,220
to you? -Nonsense. He is not attached to anyone.

78
00:08:59,010 --> 00:09:03,150
People have always been for him the building material of history.

79
00:09:04,210 --> 00:09:08,230
-You are not just a man to him. You are much more to him.

80
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,140
Judge

81
00:09:19,020 --> 00:09:20,160
-What did you see there?

82
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,090
- See, it's the monarch.

83
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:32,020
In spring and summer these butterflies live only a few days.

84
00:09:33,050 --> 00:09:36,230
And to those of them who are born in the autumn, God gives life in whole lengths

85
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:41,110
7 months, so that they flew to the warm regions, survived there the winter

86
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,020
and continued their lineage.

87
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:45,100
It's funny, is not it?

88
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,110
- And unfair.

89
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:58,030
-Leon knows he can not survive the winter, Frank.

90
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:02,230
"Why are you here, then?"

91
00:10:12,030 --> 00:10:15,020
"To ask you to be a merciful judge, Frank."

92
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:39,180
- Hell, you're crazy.

93
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:44,130
-Who is not going to live long, rarely refuses

94
00:10:44,150 --> 00:10:48,020
in earthly pleasures. -Require even after sex

95
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,030
talk about death? "Sex and death are not so little common.

96
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:56,080
Will you? -No, I do not like to stupefy the brain.

97
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,050
"It's not for the brain, Frank." This is for pain relief.

98
00:11:02,170 --> 00:11:05,190
-For you, artists, everything around you is pain.

99
00:11:07,160 --> 00:11:11,230
-In 18 years I had an accident. The bus in which I was traveling,

100
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,160
collided with a tram. My leg is broken in 11 places.

101
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:23,030
I had broken ribs, collarbone, a backbone in three places.

102
00:11:25,080 --> 00:11:28,240
And the rail of that bus pulled me apart like a skewer,

103
00:11:29,010 --> 00:11:31,160
coming out here, and broke all the bones of the pelvis.

104
00:11:32,230 --> 00:11:37,130
It's stupid, is not it? To lose virginity by a bus rail.

105
00:11:41,070 --> 00:11:42,240
It's not a game, Frank.

106
00:11:45,160 --> 00:11:47,200
I'm 33, and almost half my life it hurts.

107
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:52,160
Physically. And I will never have children.

108
00:11:57,100 --> 00:12:00,040
-Tell me about Trotsky better. -What for?

109
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,150
You yourself can ask him about anything.

110
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:09,150
-You asked me to be a merciful judge. The judge has the right

111
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:11,050
interrogate witnesses.

112
00:12:12,170 --> 00:12:15,240
-Good. What do you want to know about?

113
00:12:17,190 --> 00:12:21,080
How did we become lovers? -No. It does not interest me.

114
00:12:22,130 --> 00:12:24,100
Tell me more about his children.

115
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:28,020
Did he really love them?

116
00:12:29,150 --> 00:12:34,050
-Leon never was a good father. But this does not mean that he

117
00:12:34,070 --> 00:12:36,010
did not worry about their children.

118
00:12:38,070 --> 00:12:41,080
At least that part of it that was human.

119
00:12:42,090 --> 00:12:43,200
ORCHESTRA PLAYS MARCH

120
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,110
-There were so many people, and everyone came to listen to Dad.

121
00:12:51,000 --> 00:12:54,150
And do you remember that our grandfather took Chaliapin to Odessa? It seems to me, even there

122
00:12:54,170 --> 00:12:58,140
people were less. - You are dirty, Ninka. Chaliapin - who is he?

123
00:12:58,230 --> 00:13:01,160
So, the singer. And then the revolution!

124
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:05,160
-Fedya, you look, what stole!

125
00:13:10,150 --> 00:13:14,130
- Comrade Chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, sign it urgently. Attachment for distribution

126
00:13:14,150 --> 00:13:18,060
weapons to the workers of the Petrograd garrison. Kerensky forbade it,

127
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:21,170
and he immediately ordered Peter and Paul to disarm. What does it mean?

128
00:13:21,190 --> 00:13:24,030
And the Cossacks will give out all their weapons.

129
00:13:24,050 --> 00:13:26,240
-Content dual power! Oh, as Lenin does not have enough!

130
00:13:27,010 --> 00:13:30,170
-Vladimir Ilyich prefers to sit in a safe house

131
00:13:30,190 --> 00:13:33,000
and write letters. -How? And we heard,

132
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:35,000
that he is abroad.

133
00:13:37,020 --> 00:13:41,090
-I'm sure Comrade Koba could tell where he is hiding

134
00:13:41,110 --> 00:13:43,240
from prying eyes, Comrade Lenin.

135
00:13:46,020 --> 00:13:47,130
-Dad!

136
00:13:48,010 --> 00:13:49,150
-We are here! - Dad, we're here!

137
00:13:49,170 --> 00:13:51,030
- My girls!

138
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:56,210
How do you like the revolution? Not scary? -Why are we to be afraid, when with us

139
00:13:56,230 --> 00:13:59,030
Comrade Trotsky himself?

140
00:13:59,150 --> 00:14:01,150
- Daddy, are we going to drive by car?

141
00:14:02,190 --> 00:14:07,020
-And how! I promised. -Lev Davidovich, we are late.

142
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:12,120
-After the performance wait for me - and we'll go.

143
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,190
Yes.

144
00:14:15,140 --> 00:14:22,080
-Who commands the minds, he commands the world. Today our minds

145
00:14:22,100 --> 00:14:29,220
the revolution commands. A little bit more, brothers, sisters, a little more -

146
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,050
and the world will change forever!

147
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:38,110
CHORUS: Hurray!

148
00:14:40,040 --> 00:14:45,060
-But what is the working mass watching at the moment?

149
00:14:45,180 --> 00:14:51,020
It observes, firstly, the complete disorganization of the state,

150
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:56,150
and secondly, the incessant embezzlement of representatives of capital.

151
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:02,240
And in this situation, every worker has a full psychological right

152
00:15:03,010 --> 00:15:08,050
say to myself: "If there is a disintegration, if the capitalists continue

153
00:15:08,070 --> 00:15:13,150
rob, why should I remain silent? I will present a maximum of requirements

154
00:15:13,170 --> 00:15:20,130
and I'll take what I can. "And this is the inevitable result of the state of things.

155
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:25,070
But is this the result to which we all aspired?

156
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:28,010
-No! -Golden power!

157
00:15:28,030 --> 00:15:32,050
Power to the people! -Pretty! Have satiated on a throat!

158
00:15:32,070 --> 00:15:35,240
Enough! -How can!..

159
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:51,000
- Believe me. On that day, at the time when the country will be at the head of the

160
00:15:51,020 --> 00:15:57,070
such power in which each worker sees the expression of his own

161
00:15:57,090 --> 00:16:04,140
he will say: "Yes, this power will not deceive me, it will not steal." And exactly

162
00:16:04,160 --> 00:16:10,160
on this day, at this hour a new state will appear -

163
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:14,140
state of justice. -Hooray!

164
00:16:24,120 --> 00:16:30,010
Unfortunately, there are still random people in the revolution.

165
00:16:31,080 --> 00:16:38,150
The mediocrity that decides with its help is its own personal lowland

166
00:16:38,170 --> 00:16:44,210
tasks. They tell us: "It's not time yet." They tell us:

167
00:16:44,230 --> 00:16:51,050
"Everything will happen itself." I say "No". I am talking now...

168
00:16:51,070 --> 00:16:52,230
or never ".

169
00:16:54,100 --> 00:16:56,000
Yay!

170
00:16:57,170 --> 00:16:59,110
-Park Kerensky!

171
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:05,240
Yay!

172
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,220
"Trotsky, brother, have a drink with us!"

173
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:16,190
-Thank you. -Dad! Dad!

174
00:17:23,240 --> 00:17:27,150
-I will not sign this. So tell him. Let yourself

175
00:17:27,170 --> 00:17:31,030
copes. And no negotiations with Kerensky.

176
00:17:31,050 --> 00:17:34,190
"Well said, Comrade Trotsky. I'll memorise.

177
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:39,110
-No time to talk to you, Comrade Koba. Someone is waiting for me.

178
00:17:39,130 --> 00:17:41,090
-And with Lenin?

179
00:18:10,190 --> 00:18:16,170
Do not be afraid, Comrade Trotsky. This is Comrade Lenin's personal guard.

180
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:21,120
-What kind of cheap spy fiction, Koba?

181
00:18:21,140 --> 00:18:24,180
Where is Vladimir Ilyich? -Go.

182
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:32,160
(Fire)

183
00:18:32,180 --> 00:18:34,050
(Yells)

184
00:18:37,210 --> 00:18:40,110
-Where is Papa? He could not forget about us.

185
00:18:41,080 --> 00:18:44,130
- Stop whining. He will definitely come back here, I know.

186
00:18:45,140 --> 00:18:47,080
Nina!

187
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,120
-Bright, Vladimir Ilyich. Masking, personal guards. You definitely

188
00:19:22,140 --> 00:19:26,070
read these newfangled spy novels.

189
00:19:26,090 --> 00:19:30,000
-Your irony is inappropriate, Trotsky. It's because you did everything to make sure,

190
00:19:30,020 --> 00:19:33,160
so that I was forced to start running, and myself slowly cleaned up

191
00:19:33,180 --> 00:19:37,060
to the hands of power in my party. - It's not your party.

192
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:42,000
-Yes? It is interesting, but whose? Is it not yours?

193
00:19:42,210 --> 00:19:44,200
-This is the party of the working people.

194
00:19:46,210 --> 00:19:48,220
- Nina, stop! Nina!

195
00:19:49,140 --> 00:19:51,230
Help! Nina!

196
00:19:52,190 --> 00:19:53,240
No!

197
00:19:55,230 --> 00:19:57,050
(Yells)

198
00:19:59,140 --> 00:20:01,180
Nina! Nina!

199
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:05,080
-And you never thought, what then?

200
00:20:05,100 --> 00:20:07,070
-Later? -Later.

201
00:20:07,180 --> 00:20:11,070
Well, imagine: the revolution was over, the power passed into hands

202
00:20:11,090 --> 00:20:15,110
the Bolshevik Party, in the country of ruin, war is inevitable.

203
00:20:15,130 --> 00:20:17,030
- I'm not afraid of that.

204
00:20:18,060 --> 00:20:24,210
-Yes, yes, I know. But how do you think, when the euphoria of the revolution passes,

205
00:20:24,230 --> 00:20:29,130
How long will a Russian people-worshiper tolerate a Jewish ruler?

206
00:20:34,020 --> 00:20:39,090
Here, Trotsky, you have two ways: either humble yourself and follow me,

207
00:20:39,110 --> 00:20:42,040
or get out. There will be no compromise.

208
00:20:42,150 --> 00:20:46,230
Show discretion now. And then stay with business.

209
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:50,060
Become ... the second person in the party.

210
00:20:52,220 --> 00:20:54,180
Think about it

211
00:20:56,180 --> 00:20:58,150
- And if I refuse?

212
00:21:02,180 --> 00:21:06,150
-And then you will be swept away. Like Kerensky. Ugh!

213
00:21:06,170 --> 00:21:09,180
For your life no one will give a penny to a broken one.

214
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:14,240
(Yells)

215
00:21:20,160 --> 00:21:23,010
- You know ... I thought.

216
00:21:33,180 --> 00:21:36,150
Go to hell, Comrade Lenin.

217
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,000
Zinochka, is something wrong?

218
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,120
-I just wanted to ask: did you ever think about us?

219
00:22:10,100 --> 00:22:17,120
-Sorry ... Now such a moment, so many ...

220
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:20,160
everything is going on ... -You did not answer.

221
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:27,140
- I had a very important conversation.

222
00:22:28,140 --> 00:22:30,170
- Important conversation! ..

223
00:22:40,220 --> 00:22:45,020
While you had an important conversation, Nina was hardly trampled to death.

224
00:23:11,020 --> 00:23:12,150
{717}{}{Goodbye!}

225
00:23:13,110 --> 00:23:15,090
-Frank, do you remember? ..

226
00:23:17,010 --> 00:23:20,070
Be gentle with him. You are welcome.

227
00:23:20,220 --> 00:23:22,140
I'll do my best.

228
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:41,240
Hello, Comrade Trotsky.

229
00:23:51,090 --> 00:23:55,220
Do you know what the father feels when his children died?

230
00:23:57,080 --> 00:24:00,160
It turns

231
00:24:00,180 --> 00:24:03,010
in the animal,

232
00:24:03,030 --> 00:24:07,110
able only to howl at the moon.

233
00:24:09,230 --> 00:24:15,160
Then gradually this animal

234
00:24:15,180 --> 00:24:20,010
out of you, and a man returns,

235
00:24:20,030 --> 00:24:26,240
only already empty inside,

236
00:24:27,010 --> 00:24:30,160
but still thinking.

237
00:24:30,180 --> 00:24:36,200
And this is the worst thing, because when there are no thoughts,

238
00:24:36,220 --> 00:24:41,000
you just howl. It is easier.

239
00:24:41,170 --> 00:24:46,170
And then they appear,

240
00:24:46,190 --> 00:24:50,210
obsessive suicidal thoughts.

241
00:24:54,210 --> 00:24:59,240
Why were they born if they left before you?

242
00:25:01,110 --> 00:25:07,100
For what purpose? Not just the same. It can not be just like that.

243
00:25:07,210 --> 00:25:14,090
It eats you from the inside, it sounds in your head 24 hours a day ...

244
00:25:15,070 --> 00:25:21,180
How the jukebox breaks sometimes and puts the same

245
00:25:21,200 --> 00:25:27,030
plate in a circle. You try to stop, but it's impossible.

246
00:25:27,160 --> 00:25:33,100
All the time the same melody. Same.

247
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:40,000
"I should hate you, but I do not feel hatred at all."

248
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,200
Only pity.

249
00:25:48,180 --> 00:25:53,110
-You never had children. You do not even get to understand ...

250
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:57,090
what am I talking about...

251
00:25:58,180 --> 00:26:03,160
The devil's a moralist. "It's a pity."

252
00:26:03,180 --> 00:26:07,080
- I just wanted to ... - Would you like to regret it?

253
00:26:07,230 --> 00:26:11,030
Go away, pity Sylvia.

254
00:26:11,050 --> 00:26:15,160
She, poor thing, does not wait, that you will make her an offer,

255
00:26:15,180 --> 00:26:18,150
While you are lying around from bed with Frida.

256
00:26:20,050 --> 00:26:24,040
What, they thought, I do not know anything? Frida warned me,

257
00:26:24,060 --> 00:26:30,060
that he is going to have breakfast with you. And believe me, I know perfectly well,

258
00:26:30,080 --> 00:26:34,180
which means breakfast with Frida.

259
00:26:36,150 --> 00:26:39,220
-Yes, you are right, I have no children.

260
00:26:39,240 --> 00:26:43,000
And maybe it will not. But even I perfectly understand,

261
00:26:43,020 --> 00:26:45,200
that there is nothing worse than children suffering for their father,

262
00:26:45,220 --> 00:26:48,000
imagining himself a messiah.

263
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,200
And yes, I'm sorry for you. Pity is the only thing you have achieved

264
00:26:54,220 --> 00:26:57,050
in the declining years.

265
00:27:01,070 --> 00:27:05,030
Dont touch me! -Why are you doing this to me?

266
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:09,040
-I'm sorry, I completely broke my head because of this interview.

267
00:27:09,060 --> 00:27:12,140
- You do not even come to me. I forgot when we were last

268
00:27:12,160 --> 00:27:14,060
with you fell asleep.

269
00:27:15,110 --> 00:27:19,120
-Silvia, I myself am not my last time. He is like the devil.

270
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,020
Every day I drink a drop of my soul. I no longer sleep at night.

271
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:26,130
I drink sleeping pills - one hell, I can not sleep until morning.

272
00:27:26,150 --> 00:27:29,110
-I do not recognize you. You have changed.

273
00:27:30,080 --> 00:27:33,120
I'm afraid of you. Let's go to me. Go.

274
00:27:34,070 --> 00:27:36,160
Go. - I can not, Sylvia.

275
00:27:36,180 --> 00:27:39,100
-Oh please. -I must finish this job.

276
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:43,200
-Can it be better to tell her about you and Frida?

277
00:27:51,130 --> 00:27:58,090
You do not like Sylvia, but there's such an excuse to drop the ballast.

278
00:27:59,210 --> 00:28:04,160
- Tell me about your ballast, Comrade Trotsky.

279
00:28:09,130 --> 00:28:12,230
Why did you abandon power when it was already in your hands?

280
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:18,050
-Why do you think so? I did not refuse anything.

281
00:28:37,110 --> 00:28:41,020
-Lev Davidovich, Kamenev called, he said: you urgently collect

282
00:28:41,040 --> 00:28:44,170
all here ... -Yes. We will do it today.

283
00:28:45,170 --> 00:28:47,090
-What will we do?

284
00:28:49,000 --> 00:28:50,190
-Revolution.

285
00:28:52,170 --> 00:28:57,240
-Wait, Lenin said about the 27th, today only the 25th.

286
00:28:58,010 --> 00:29:02,110
-We will do it today. Collect the sailors.

287
00:29:08,220 --> 00:29:11,050
CASH

288
00:29:35,080 --> 00:29:38,140
-I have nothing to please you. This is Spanish. The virus is new,

289
00:29:38,160 --> 00:29:41,160
not yet studied. Mortality rate is 20%.

290
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:48,210
Lev Davidovich, listen, so it is impossible. There is no doubt,

291
00:29:48,230 --> 00:29:52,030
you are the chairman of the Petrograd Soviet, but you can not force

292
00:29:52,050 --> 00:29:56,190
we choose between you and Lenin. -Lenin ...

293
00:29:59,060 --> 00:30:02,020
And where is he, your Lenin? A?

294
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,140
Where is he?

295
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,130
Damn it, huh? No, there is none.

296
00:30:12,150 --> 00:30:17,200
Fiction. Oh, letters in the hands of the Georgian - that's all your Lenin.

297
00:30:17,220 --> 00:30:21,130
And you continue to obey him blindly.

298
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:26,170
-Natalya Ivanovna, and when will dad come?

299
00:30:26,190 --> 00:30:29,150
-I do not know, he's been spending the night in Petrosoviet.

300
00:30:30,140 --> 00:30:32,100
-I'll go get him.

301
00:30:32,220 --> 00:30:34,170
- Zin, wait!

302
00:30:34,190 --> 00:30:38,090
-Natalya Ivanovna, I'll need a basin with cold water.

303
00:30:45,180 --> 00:30:49,030
-And where are you going? -I will not let you go anywhere.

304
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,130
-Yes, now you are here, you are the leader. But Lenin created our party

305
00:30:55,150 --> 00:31:00,020
and led us to what we possess. He led us for more than 10 years.

306
00:31:00,040 --> 00:31:03,200
And how many are you in the Bolsheviks? -Polgoda.

307
00:31:03,220 --> 00:31:05,180
-Polgoda.

308
00:31:17,220 --> 00:31:22,040
- Either you join me today in history,

309
00:31:22,060 --> 00:31:25,000
or you will be on the roadside tomorrow.

310
00:31:28,240 --> 00:31:30,220
Choose.

311
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:55,010
Act according to plan. I must report every half hour.

312
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:14,040
STRESSED MUSIC

313
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:18,220
-Who are temporary here ?! Give up!

314
00:33:38,160 --> 00:33:43,070
-Kerensky fled, the Provisional Government was arrested.

315
00:33:44,000 --> 00:33:47,070
In some places they still resist, but ... -What losses?

316
00:33:47,210 --> 00:33:50,130
-20 people. - Only twenty?

317
00:33:50,150 --> 00:33:55,080
- You do not seem to be happy. -Yes, I'm glad, glad.

318
00:33:56,200 --> 00:34:03,150
And how our Jew arrived from Dorogobuzh.

319
00:34:04,150 --> 00:34:09,040
And his horse's not dumb.

320
00:34:09,160 --> 00:34:15,190
He went to Lenin to torture: "What can I do with the horse?"

321
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:21,000
- Lev Davidovich, are you all right? -Zinoviev, you were never told,

322
00:34:21,020 --> 00:34:24,110
that the expectation of happiness - this is the most real happiness?

323
00:34:24,130 --> 00:34:27,050
-What? -When you live a dream, it gives strength,

324
00:34:27,070 --> 00:34:31,060
great forces. And when you realize your dream, why live further?

325
00:34:31,080 --> 00:34:34,100
Ah, Zinoviev? Did not say? -No.

326
00:34:37,150 --> 00:34:39,160
-Dad! - What are you doing at such a time?

327
00:34:39,180 --> 00:34:41,230
-Serozha is very sick, he has a Spanish woman.

328
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,160
-What?! -This is very bad. He can die.

329
00:34:44,180 --> 00:34:47,070
The doctor said that the death rate is 20%.

330
00:34:49,040 --> 00:34:50,230
It is clear.

331
00:34:51,080 --> 00:34:57,200
I'll be back in two hours. Collect all, we must announce our victory.

332
00:34:59,090 --> 00:35:01,220
What should we do with the filly?

333
00:35:01,240 --> 00:35:03,140
Come on.

334
00:35:15,060 --> 00:35:17,080
"What have you done, Trotsky?"

335
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:20,130
-This is called a "revolution," Vladimir Ilyich.

336
00:35:20,150 --> 00:35:25,070
-It? This is not a revolution, it is a revolution! This is a fucking robbery.

337
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:27,140
bank! It's not America, dammit!

338
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:31,020
"Comrades, take the car, take my children home, then ..."

339
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:35,090
come back for me. -Will be done, Comrade Trotsky!

340
00:35:35,210 --> 00:35:39,240
Please come home. -Home, home!

341
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:47,200
Yes, I made a coup. But you will all call it a revolution,

342
00:35:47,220 --> 00:35:51,110
if you want to save face. You will need it.

343
00:35:57,030 --> 00:36:03,000
You were right, Vladimir Ilyich. Russia never recognizes the leader of a Jew.

344
00:36:04,150 --> 00:36:05,240
Never.

345
00:36:08,140 --> 00:36:11,190
But the revolution must have a leader. The choice is yours.

346
00:36:36,060 --> 00:36:40,030
-I almost forgot. You have a birthday today, Trotsky.

347
00:36:42,130 --> 00:36:43,170
Congratulations!

348
00:36:53,020 --> 00:36:54,160
Thank you

349
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:57,010
CROWD LIKE

350
00:36:57,030 --> 00:36:59,200
- Comrades! Comrades!

351
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:06,120
Comrades! The workers 'and peasants' revolution, about the necessity of which

352
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:09,160
all the time the Bolsheviks said it was done!

353
00:37:10,010 --> 00:37:11,170
CHORUS: Hurray!

354
00:37:22,070 --> 00:37:26,020
-The word is given to Comrade Trotsky.

355
00:37:27,220 --> 00:37:30,050
THE CROWD SCANDES: Trotsky! Trotsky!

356
00:37:32,210 --> 00:37:34,120
Trotsky! Trotsky!

357
00:37:41,040 --> 00:37:45,240
- Comrades! We have longed for this for many days.

358
00:37:47,150 --> 00:37:51,230
And today our dream has come true.

359
00:37:53,020 --> 00:37:56,230
The proletarian revolution won!

360
00:37:57,100 --> 00:37:58,220
Yay!

361
00:38:00,020 --> 00:38:01,230
Yay!

362
00:38:04,070 --> 00:38:09,130
"And the Bolshevik Party carried out this revolution!"

363
00:38:10,040 --> 00:38:12,000
Yay!

364
00:38:13,020 --> 00:38:14,220
Yay!

365
00:38:18,060 --> 00:38:24,200
"The last time Vladimir Ilyich Lenin rarely visited the Petrograd Soviet.

366
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:29,190
He withdrew from his work.

367
00:38:35,220 --> 00:38:39,060
So it may seem at first glance.

368
00:38:39,080 --> 00:38:42,090
But this is not so, comrades.

369
00:38:42,110 --> 00:38:46,140
The victory of the proletarian revolution is primarily our responsibility

370
00:38:46,160 --> 00:38:52,100
this person. It was he who developed the plan for the revolution.

371
00:38:52,200 --> 00:38:59,060
It was on his instructions that revolutionary sailors and soldiers acted.

372
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:03,010
This he led the uprising. Glory to Comrade Lenin,

373
00:39:03,030 --> 00:39:05,030
leader of the Bolshevik Party!

374
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:07,140
Glory to Comrade Lenin!

375
00:39:09,020 --> 00:39:10,160
Yay!

376
00:39:48,010 --> 00:39:49,190
-Nata!

377
00:39:50,150 --> 00:39:52,050
Natasha!

378
00:39:53,030 --> 00:39:57,170
Have you heard this before? Damn it, we did! We won!

379
00:39:58,170 --> 00:40:01,000
A? -Congratulations.

380
00:40:04,220 --> 00:40:06,160
Happy birthday, honey.

381
00:40:09,140 --> 00:40:11,050
-How is Seryozha?

382
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,160
-It's better. -What?

383
00:41:07,200 --> 00:41:10,240
-You went to the dream for twenty years, like an obsessive ...

384
00:41:11,220 --> 00:41:15,090
despising their principles and drowning all those who interfered with you, and then took

385
00:41:15,110 --> 00:41:20,000
and so easily gave power to their sworn opponent?

386
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:21,130
Why?

387
00:41:22,120 --> 00:41:26,060
-The truth-Jew really could not hold out in Russia

388
00:41:26,080 --> 00:41:31,020
and months. For the sake of power, Lenin would split the party. And one by one

389
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:38,050
we were doomed. Power has never been an end in itself for me.

390
00:41:38,070 --> 00:41:44,080
Next to Lenin, as part of the ruling party, I could continue to walk

391
00:41:44,100 --> 00:41:48,180
to its true and only goal. -Yes, yes, I know.

392
00:41:48,200 --> 00:41:52,220
To inflame the fire of the world revolution. -A, becoming the dictator of Russia, I would

393
00:41:52,240 --> 00:41:59,050
bound his hands. The road to victory does not always mean forward.

394
00:41:59,070 --> 00:42:03,000
We must be able to maneuver. Sometimes you need to stop and wait.

395
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,130
-Nonsense! You yourself do not disgust?

396
00:42:06,100 --> 00:42:10,200
Look at yourself. It's not you, it's some demagogue, a weakling!

397
00:42:10,220 --> 00:42:16,070
-And you do not have the intelligence to distinguish real politics from demagoguery.

398
00:42:16,090 --> 00:42:20,180
-I do not believe you. You forced your family to suffer for the sake of revolution.

399
00:42:20,200 --> 00:42:24,050
And then they took and abandoned this very revolution, frightened

400
00:42:24,080 --> 00:42:28,010
responsibility! Your family suffered in vain. Your son could die,

401
00:42:28,030 --> 00:42:32,040
not seeing his father, in vain! - He's already died.

402
00:42:33,210 --> 00:42:36,110
They all died.

403
00:42:59,060 --> 00:43:01,020
-Dad...

404
00:44:52,220 --> 00:44:54,200
-So early?

405
00:44:54,220 --> 00:44:56,240
What, is there an excuse?

406
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:01,090
- Here, a new frame was brought.

407
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,180
Here it is.

408
00:45:56,150 --> 00:45:58,010
Sit down.

409
00:45:58,180 --> 00:46:00,080
- Dad!

410
00:46:00,170 --> 00:46:03,050
We still love you. You're our dad.

411
00:46:03,190 --> 00:46:05,190
Come here,...

412
00:46:16,030 --> 00:46:17,240
My children! ..
